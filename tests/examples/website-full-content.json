But from \nthe perspective we have today, post-Covid Europe seems pretty similar to the pre-pan-\ndemic landscape. \nWe use more technology, exercise sanitary caution, and keep our distance a little more. \nAnd while there have been job losses and challenging conditions in certain industries, \nthere have also been some positive aspects, such as better financed healthcare infra-\nstructure and more time spent with families. As 2021 closed out, the biggest challenges \nseemed manageable, and people moved to a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d mode of operating. \nBut just as we started congratulating ourselves for our flexibility and resilience over \nthe past two years, February 24th happened, and a major political, humanitarian, and \neconomic catastrophe unfolded in Ukraine following Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion. From \nthat day on, we have had to reassess how our world is changing \u2013 in Europe and across \nthe globe \u2013 on an almost daily basis. \nWhether we are sitting in Warsaw, London, Helsinki or Washington, this crisis relates to all \nof us and threatens many aspects of our lives. One thing that makes me feel comforted \nis the fact that all of us here in the European Union, as well as in the US, are standing \ntogether and working hand-in-hand to support our friends and protect our future. Last \nyear, agility was the most critical aspect of our business. But today, despite the macro \nsituation or perhaps even because of it, the most important thing is \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \nKeep going. Deliver.\nOur ESG focus in 2021 was centered around \nthe ESG 2023 Universe project, with particular \nattention paid to the execution of our Climate \nManifesto. \nAll our portfolio companies are now very familiar with measurement and reduction of \ncarbon footprints and understand and efficiently operate reporting tools. Together, \nthese companies form a regional vanguard of sustainability champions, and our target \nof full neutrality in 2025 remains unchanged. \nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nESG Report 2021  |  Introduction\nI am grateful to all our management teams for their work, which helps Abris, as a finan-\ncial institution, demonstrate its full readiness to operate under new EU SFDR regulations. \nThis achievement is incredibly important for our sustainability. \n2021 was also a breakthrough year for our portfolio in terms of multidimensional value \nenhancement. I was very impressed to see so many digitization projects executed, es-\npecially in the cyber security and Human Resources management areas. Today, digital \nmanagement tools are a must-have, and such broad buy-in proves how professional \nand courageous our managers are. And since digital is the new reality, we saw several \nrebranding and digital marketing campaigns in 2021, helping to connect our businesses \nto their respective markets in a more effective way. All these projects feed into our ESG \nplans and are documented in our Scoring Application as evidence of value creation.\nFinally, I would like to reveal a small part of what the future holds for our ESG efforts. \nIn\u00a02022 we have created a dedicated taskforce to explore the topic of diversity, equity \nand inclusion (DEI). Our ambition is to deliver a comprehensive DEI program across our \nportfolio that will unite, empower and energize our teams, but at the same time help \nbuild stronger businesses. \nI hope you will read the 2021 edition of our ESG Report with interest and join me in ap-\npreciating the tremendous work done by all the people involved - the Abris team, the \nportfolio teams and our investors for the continuous encouragement they give us to \nreach even higher. \nSo far, 2022 has already brought Abris the best ESG Private Equity fund in Europe Award. \nThis seals and closes a chapter for us. But as always, \u201cthe end\u201d is a good place to start \nthe next challenge.\nSincerely,\nPawel Gierynski\nManaging Partner\n Abris Capital Partners\n10\n11\nemployed in the \nportfolio\nAbris Capital Partners\n11\nAbris is one of the leading independent private \nequity fund managers investing in Central  \nEurope, building regional champions through \nESG transformation.

Our specialization, ESG transformation, \nis one of the key building blocks of strong \nperformance.\nTo achieve our goals, we have developed \na\u00a0comprehensive ESG strategy - Abris ESG \nUniverse 2023. \nThree pillars of ESG Universe 2023\n\u2022\t Pillar I \u2013 Abris as a model organization\n\u2022\t Pillar II \u2013 End-to-end processes \n\u2022\t Pillar III \u2013 ESG thought leader\nOur strategy has also been planned to adhere \nmore closely to the UN Sustainable Develop-\nment Goals. \nOur strategic ESG activities that build the value \nof our investments, also support the achieve-\nment of sustainable development goals. Abris \nfocuses on supporting the following SDGs:\nSDG 12\t Responsible Consumption and \n\t\nProduction\nSDG 13\t Climate Change\nSDG 3\t\nGood Health and well-being\nSDG 5\t\nGender Equality\nSDG 8\t\nDecent Work and Economic Growth\nSDG 9\t\nIndustry Innovation and Infrastructure\nSDG 16\t Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\nS\nG\nE\nESG UNIVERSE 2023 STRATEGY - \nwe know where we are going\nThe foundation of this strategy is the Abris \nClimate Manifesto, in which we set out our \ntarget to achieve climate neutrality across our \nentire investment portfolio by 2025.\nAbris\u2019 ESG Universe sets out our \nresponsible strategy for the coming \nyears. \nESG Universe 2023 provides a comprehensive, \noverarching structure for all our ESG work. It \nencompasses 17 projects across four key cat-\negories: governance and culture; standards; \neducation; and carbon neutrality. \nGovernance and culture \u2013 Abris has built a \nclear, well-defined, and fully tested approach \nto integrating ESG into its investment activity. \nWe aim to be pragmatic and practical while \noptimizing risk management and value cre-\nation. Every procedure and tool we create is \nrequired to prove its efficiency and purpose. \nTherefore, the first pillar of this strategy is about \nmaking Abris a role model organization for our \nportfolio companies and for the wider private \nequity ecosystem. Our internal governance \nand culture must allow for consistent delivery \nof that purpose. \nStandards - We strive to improve our current \ntools and develop new ones to strengthen \nefficiency and sharpen the decision-making \nprocess. By creating a database of all ESG \nprocedures, we build the knowledge and \nexperience of the team. We develop models \nin individual ESG areas and are clear about \nour points of reference, in order to allow us to \nevaluate the effectiveness of our activities.\nEducation - Knowledge allows us to build \nawareness, and awareness allows for rational \nand effective actions. We have built an exten-\nsive ESG knowledge base for the Abris team \nand are investing more in education for Abris \nstaff and for our portfolio companies.\nCarbon neutrality - Since carbon footprint \nreduction should be one of the most important \nmissions for every management team across \nthe world, we want Abris to be a frontrunner for \nprivate equity in this area. Our ambition is to \nachieve a carbon neutral portfolio by 2025. \n \nESG thought \nleader\nEnd-to-end  \nESG \nprocesses\nAbris as \na model ESG \norganization\nESG Report 2021  |  Abris as a responsible investor\n 20\nClimate change is one of the most significant \nchallenges currently facing humanity. Under \nthe Paris Agreement, countries have agreed to \naim to hold the increase in the global average \ntemperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-in-\ndustrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. Limiting global \nwarming is the higher aim of the Paris Agree-\nment and is necessary in order to mitigate the \nmost severe long-term economic and environ-\nmental consequences of climate change.\nAbris recognises that business has a vital role \nto play in addressing climate change, and that \nits actions can deliver economic, social and \nenvironmental benefits over the long term.\nTo mitigate the worst effects of climate \nchange, all companies will need to plan for \ncarbon neutrality. The costs associated with \nthis change are an obligation for future in-\nvestors. As well as being the right thing to do, \naddressing them today will also make our \nbusinesses more valuable.\nIn 2021 Abris launched its Climate Manifesto \u2013 \na\u00a0plan to reach carbon neutrality across our \nportfolio by 2025, to prepare for net zero and \nto ensure that all our portfolio companies lead \nthe field in terms of sustainable investment.\nCLIMATE MANIFESTO \u2013 \nwe know what is \nmost important\nKey actions of Abris\u2019 Climate Manifesto:\nFrom 2022, Abris\u2019 Warsaw \noffice is 100% carbon neutral\n1.\t Achieving carbon neutrality at Abris by 2023 \nAs a responsible investor, we are committed to becoming carbon \nneutral in our own operations by 2023 \n \n2.\t Developing an effective balancing model by 2023 \nWe aim to develop a carbon-neutral balancing model for our entire \ninvestment portfolio, to ensure each new company is able to reach \nits carbon-neutral goal \n \n3.\t Achieving a carbon-neutral portfolio by 2025 \nWe will create ambitious reduction action plans and a catalog of \noffset initiatives for our portfolio companies in order to achieve \na\u00a0carbon-neutral portfolio by 2025 \n \n4.\t Developing an agile climate change strategy \nfor our portfolio companies \nTogether with our portfolio companies, we will adopt \nstrategies for climate change and build a resilience plan based on \nTCFD recommendations \n \n5.\t Building a net zero strategy pathway for our \nportfolio companies by 2030 \nFollowing each successful exit, Abris will provide each portfolio \ncompany with a detailed action plan on how to address \nthe transition to net zero\n Abris Capital Partners\n22\n23\nThe strategic goals defined in Abris\u2019 ESG \nUniverse 2023 are interconnected.

This \nmeans creating an effective ESG governance \nstructure and developing the standards and \ntools that make our ESG activities effective. \nApplying the principles of responsible invest-\nment requires an appropriate management \nsystem that ensures that ESG is part of our \nDNA. Therefore, every area of Abris, covering all \nbodies, committees, roles and decision-making \nareas within the firm, has a responsibility to in-\nclude the principles of responsible investment \nin everyday decisions and actions. \nBuilding a model ESG organization is the \nresponsibility of the entire team, supported by \nour dedicated ESG Team. We are constantly \nlearning, and we want to be better and better. \nThat is why we set up our ESG Academy, in \norder to help us gain knowledge that allows \nus to think about responsible investing not \nonly ideologically, but also pragmatically and \npractically.\nWe have a dedicated ESG Team, which is a \npart of the Value Enhancement Team, com-\nprising a Partner, the ESG Director, a Technol-\nogy Director, a Value Enhancement Manager \nand a Value Enhancement Associate.\nPillars of ESG Universe 2023 \nI.

In 2021, we invested \n\u20ac64,372 in charging stations. To boost sales \nand raise awareness among our customers, \nthe new e-mobility landing page has been \nlaunched on our website, promoting the ben-\nefits and dispelling myths about EVs. Further \ndevelopment of the landing page is planned. \nWe are actively improving the qualifications \nof our employees in the field of e-mobility. Our \nfirst EV training program was held in 2021 and \nwas attended by 406 employees, mostly from \nthe purchasing and sales teams. We strive to \nlead by example, therefore we are introducing \nEVs and hybrid vehicles into our company fleet. \nIn 2021, AURES operated a total of 41 EVs and \nhybrids within its company cars and rental \nfleets, representing 3% of all vehicles. \nEnvironment\nA new landing page about e-mobility has \nbeen launched, promoting the benefits and \ndispelling myths about EVs.

However, we \nchanged the existing efficiency index into a \nproductivity index in order to maximize bene-\nfits but also to decrease costs. In the case of \nbonuses for white collar workers, we needed \nto convert from a discretionary into a perfor-\nmance based scheme. We also decided to \nlimit the posts eligible for the bonus.

It is a counterintuitive question. \nStarting in 2019, each year I have introduced the Abris ESG Report by talking about the chang-\nes influencing our professional and personal environment and the different initiatives we \nhave undertaken to deal with these changes. Maybe now it is time to admit that the \u201cchange\u201d \nis the new reality and reflect on what really matters when dealing with this kaleidoscope. \nAn important feature of the reality of change is its complexity and multidimensional char-\nacter. Not only do many elements \u2013 both independent and related \u2013 change at the same \ntime, but they also continually generate change mutations. Therefore, what matters most in \nbuilding an adequate and a bulletproof response to change, is to account for those different \ndimensions by encouraging diversity, by looking from different points of view, opinions, and \nrisk assessments, and weaving them into a multifaceted and inclusive solution. One person\u2019s \neyes, ears and experience are not enough. \nRiding that wave, in 2022, the Abris team accepted the challenge \nof designing a new flagship ESG programme focused on building a \ndiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) toolkit. To quote my colleagues: \nthis was one of the most difficult ESG projects we have ever un-\ndertaken. Why? DEI policies might have become as common in the \nprivate equity ecosystem as accounting standards, but unfortu-\nnately, many of them hit the target but miss the point. \nOur mission was to design a practical programme, maximizing our ability to transform diverse \nintellectual potential into inclusive teams with the ability to perform at the highest level. We \nfollowed experience-based logic, assuming that to succeed in portfolio implementation we \nneeded an emotional readiness among the people expected to lead the change, as well as \nclear decision-making governance, operational ownership, and practical guidelines. And as \nalways, we at Abris needed to lead the way. I hope readers of this report will appreciate the \nAbris DEI Code and the six key commitments that form its basis. \nSpeaking about the flagship programmes, I want to recognize the efforts of our portfolio man-\nagers in delivering the important milestones of our Climate Manifesto. In 2022, we reached the \nhalfway point in achieving carbon neutrality across our portfolio. Since launching the pro-\ngram, our portfolio companies have avoided 73,439 Mg CO2e, which represents on average a \n28% reduction of emissions per million euros of revenue. Not bad at all. \nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nAnother key project that kept our ESG and financial teams busy in 2022 was preparation for \nSFDR regulations. We chose to follow the Article 8+ regime, which brings two types of chal-\nlenges: delivering compliant documentation and populating reports with historical data.  \nI am confident that, thanks to our four years effort to build appropriate database, we will soon \nbe able to share the reports with our investors. \nPlanning for 2023 and beyond, we are looking forward to the third edition of our ESG strategy: \nESG Universe 2026. I will save the details for next year\u2019s report, but one central element to all \nour new projects will be the practical application of our value creation lessons learned.\nI am delighted to present the Abris 2022 ESG Report, which summarizes our progress in \ndelivering what we have promised. I am pleased that our efforts continue to be recognized by \nmany industry bodies as the best in the region and in Europe, but what makes me truly proud \nis that the data we collect now shows the tangible, positive impact of our work on the long-\nterm value of our portfolio. \nSo, when turning these pages, please join me in congratulating all of the Abris family \u2013 portfo-\nlio managers, investment team members, the value enhancement team and support profes-\nsionals \u2013 on delivering what stands behind this report: shareholder and stakeholder value. \nHappy reading!\nPawel Gierynski\nManaging Partner\n ESG Report 2022  |  Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\n6\n7\nAbout us\n Abris Capital Partners\n8\n9\nESG Report 2022  |  About us\nAbris Capital Partners is the leading ESG transfor-\nmation specialist private equity fund manager, \nfocused on mid-market opportunities in Central \nEurope.

ESG factors are present \nthroughout the full investment process, and we plan, \nmonitor and measure the ESG impact on the busi-\nnesses we invest in.\nOur approach\nWe focus on transforming regional \nleaders into international champions, \nalways pairing business growth with \nan ESG-focused culture, carbon neu-\ntrality, DEI commitments and digital \nexcellence.

In 2022, \nin pursuit of the best-in-class standards within \u201cS\u201d \ncategory, we focused more closely on Diversity, \nEquity and Inclusion (DEI). We developed a new \nflagship program \u2013 the DEI Code \u2013 for Abris and our \nportfolio companies. We consider diversity as a cru-\ncial element of value creation, but we are also aware \nthat a commitment to DEI is a constant journey.

At the \nsame time, the strategy includes the ambitious target \nof achieving a carbon neutral portfolio by 2025 and \nputs in place net-zero action plans for each individual \nportfolio company, making Abris the first private equity \nhouse in Central Europe to commit to this goal. \nAbris\u2019 ESG strategy is based on three \npillars:\n\u2022\t Pillar I \u2013 Abris as a model organization - ensures that \nAbris is a model organization for both our portfolio \ncompanies and the wider private equity ecosystem \n\u2022\t Pillar II \u2013 End-to-end processes - integrates ESG \ncomponents into decision making milestones at \nevery stage of the investment process \n\u2022\t Pillar III \u2013 ESG thought leader - ensures we demon-\nstrate ESG leadership across the Central Europe \nregion, delivering best-in-class investor reporting \nand promoting ESG best practice\nTo reflect the evolution of our approach to ESG inte-\ngration and accommodate market requirements for \nstandardization and transparency, ESG Universe 2023 \nadheres closely to the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals.

From our own experience, and \nsupported by a canon of research and data, we know \nthat diverse teams build better, more resilient and \nmore profitable businesses. At Abris, we believe that \npeople, their attitude and effort determine whether \norganizations succeed or fail. Therefore, going the \nextra mile to understand and accommodate employ-\nees\u2019 needs, to create an inclusive working environment \nand to reward work in a fair and transparent way is \nthe path we choose.

How would you convince company \nCEOs that implementing DEI strategy cre-\nates value from a business standpoint?\n\u201cBeing good is good for business\u201d, as environmentalist \nHunter Lovins says. This applies to DEI as much as to \nany other area of ESG, and can clearly seen in results. \nDiverse teams are happier, more cohesive, and \nperform better financially as well. \nFor CEOs, it is important to focus on the business \nbenefits, emphasizing things like increased innovation, \nexpanded market opportunities, improved employee \nengagement and retention, and better decision-mak-\ning. All of this can help company CEOs understand \nthat implementing a DEI strategy is not just the right \nthing to do from a moral standpoint, but also a smart \nbusiness decision with tangible returns on investment. \nA diverse workforce brings together individuals from \ndifferent backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. \nAs a consequence, we observe diversity of thought, \nwhich can lead to increased innovation and creativity, \nas employees with diverse viewpoints bring unique \nideas and solutions to the table. This can ultimately \nlead to improved products, services and processes \nthat can positively impact a company\u2019s bottom line. \nIn my eyes this is a motivation strong enough to build \na company\u2019s culture around DEI. But from another \nangle, even just looking at the risk mitigation side is a \nsufficient motivator for some CEOs, as they acknowl-\nedge the difference DEI can make in terms of helping \nthem to protect their businesses. There are diverse \nentry points into a DEI-oriented culture.\n2. How does DEI impact a company\u2019s \nperformance?\nDEI is linked to a company\u2019s performance in multiple \nways. To think about this another way, you could ask: \nhow is your company\u2019s culture linked to its perfor-\nmance? \nFirst, we can talk about fostering innovation and \ncreativity in teams, improving employee engage-\nment and productivity, and about capturing market \nopportunities. Or perhaps we could discuss how we \ncan better understand our customers thanks to our \ninternal diversity. Attracting and retaining top talent is \nincreasingly a big issue, especially for younger gener-\nations that are highly conscious of company culture \nand reputation. \nWe can also talk about enhancing our overall reputa-\ntion and brand image, as well as entering the area of \ncorporate activism or, looking at employer branding \nand consumers expectations \u2013 brand activism. And \nlast but not least, we can again talk about mitigating \nrisks. \nIt is clear that prioritizing DEI can contribute to a \ncompany\u2019s overall success and competitiveness. It is a \npart of a purpose-focused approach, a key branding \ntouchpoint and an absolute necessity for a company \nthat wants to thrive in the new stakeholder-oriented \nbusiness landscape. \nNo DEI equals no future.\n3. What area of DEI should companies \nfocus on in the next 1-3 years?\nSpecific areas of focus may vary depending on the \nindustry, size and positioning of a company. In order \nto determine the areas that need the most attention \nand develop a comprehensive DEI strategy that is \nrelevant to their specific circumstances, companies \nmust conduct thorough assessments, engaging with \nemployees, identifying biases and cultural contexts \nand aligning DEI efforts with the company\u2019s values and \ngoals.\nThere are, however, some universal steps that every \nbusiness should consider, starting with Inclusive Lead-\nership. Companies should prioritize in their improve-\nment plans the inclusive leadership, which involves \ncultivating leaders who demonstrate inclusive behav-\niors, are aware of unconscious biases, and actively \ncreate an inclusive culture. Providing training and \ndevelopment programs for leaders that emphasize \ninclusive leadership practices can help drive positive \nchange throughout the organization. \nThere are many specific fields where inclusive leader-\nship can play a role in improving DEI culture:\nMeasurement and Accountability: Companies should \nestablish metrics and measurements to track pro-\ngress and hold themselves accountable for their DEI \ninitiatives. This includes setting specific, measurable \nand achievable goals related to DEI, and regularly re-\nviewing and reporting on progress. Companies should \nalso create mechanisms for employees to provide \nfeedback and voice concerns related to DEI, and take \naction to address them. \nEquity and Fairness: Companies should assess their \npolicies, practices, and procedures to ensure they \nare equitable and fair. This includes evaluating hiring \npractices, pay equity, promotion processes and other \nHR policies to identify and address any potential bias-\nes or inequities that may exist within the organization. \nRepresentation and Diversity: Companies should \nfocus on increasing representation and diversity at \nall levels of their organization, including leadership \npositions. This involves actively recruiting and pro-\nmoting employees from underrepresented groups, \nsetting measurable diversity goals and implementing \nstrategies to ensure that diverse talent is retained, \ndeveloped and advanced within the company. \nInclusive Culture: Companies should work on fostering \nan inclusive culture where all employees feel valued, \nrespected and included. This could involve creating \npolicies and practices that promote inclusion, such \nas flexible work arrangements, diversity training \nprograms and initiatives that celebrate diversity, as \nwell as promoting open communication, respect for \ndiverse perspectives and a sense of belonging among \nemployees. \nAll of the above initiatives should contribute to a higher \nlevel of belonging in the organization and in my eyes \nthis is the lodestar for DEI strategies in the coming \nyears.\n Abris Capital Partners\n25\nClimate Manifesto\nAs part of our ESG Universe strategy, in 2021 Abris \nannounced its Climate Manifesto  \u2013 a roadmap for \nreaching carbon neutrality across our portfolio by \n2025 and preparing companies for net zero.

During the due diligence \nprocess, we review all climate-related risks and op-\nportunities to ensure we have identified all the current \nand future potential risks at the company we plan to \ninvest in. At the same time, we always include climate \ngoals in the Exit Path planning as a part of our com-\nmitment to promote environmental characteristics. \nIn future, we expect climate risk to grow as a result of \nincreasing physical climate risks, as well as transition \nrisks, such as changing climate-related guidelines and \nregulations from governments, rising energy costs and \nsupply chain interruptions. \nFor our own offices (Warsaw, Bucharest, Cyprus) we \nhave classified acute physical climate-related risks \nas low. These risks have not affected our business, \nstrategy or financial planning. \nPortfolio company perspective\nOur portfolio companies with the biggest climate \nimpact operate in the following sectors:\n\u2022\t paper-based hygiene product manufacturing\n\u2022\t recycling and industrial waste management\n\u2022\t packaging \n\u2022\t automotive trading\n\u2022\t healthcare\nPortfolio companies operating in these sectors and \nbased in CEE are the most exposed to transition risks \ndue to their high coal dependence. These include \nhigher carbon prices, regulation on emissions and \nshifts in technology and demand. Production compa-\nnies with supply chains in Asia may have been disrupt-\ned by issues with acquiring raw materials. On the other \nhand, thanks to Abris\u2019 focus on ESG transformation, \nthese companies have performed well on emissions \nreduction and making climate-related technological \nshifts.\nMarket risks, meanwhile, may result from increased \ncosts and a shift in consumer demands, which could \nresult in increased operating costs, reduced demand \nfor products and services and increased cost, and \nreduced availability of capital.\n\u2022\t Investor perspective \n\u2022\t Abris perspective\n\u2022\t Portfolio company perspective\n\u2022\t Due diligence / investment decision\n\u2022\t Investment process (3-5 years)\n\u2022\t Period after exit (6-15 years)\nAbris has dedicated ESG professionals that are responsible for climate-related risks \nand opportunities.

This was the result of an in-depth, two-year  \ncertification process, and on May 3rd, 2023, I was genuinely proud and grateful to  \nmatch the Abris logo with the famous B Corp symbol.\nSo, where do we go from here? \nWhile the assessment of ESG standards often eludes precise measurement, the market \nnow teems with endless attempts to quantify and appraise its impact. There are so \nmany different rankings and scores out there and still so many greenwashing scandals. \nTherefore, we wanted to test our value creation methodology with something carved in \nstone; something business focused, quantitative and completely transparent. \nWith Universe 2020, we planted the tree; with Universe 2023, \nwe grew the forest; now it is time to harvest! It is the moment \nto translate our work into tangible figures, quantified in euros \nor, more precisely, in ESG-enabled EBITDA, revenues and  \nultimately valuations. \nThe new edition of our ESG strategy introduced in this report, \nUniverse 2026, will center on distilling years of gathered  \ndata and experience into concrete, documented results.  \nAs we advance in implementing that approach, we have \ndecided to strengthen our portfolio strategies with numeric \nESG targets, measurement, and data analytics. \nI am confident that our current and future investors will appreciate this approach \nand the unique value creation toolkit that we have showcased in 2023 through two \nremarkable exit successes. Furthermore, I hope readers of this report will understand the \nenhancements we implemented in 2023, putting a greater emphasis on measurement \nand data provision for each portfolio company.\nAs in the previous year, I am happy to share that our flagship Climate Manifesto  \nprogram is advancing well and continuing to deliver tangible results. The joint efforts \nof management teams and Abris have delivered a further reduction in the carbon \nfootprint across our portfolio in 2023. Our companies emitted 30,853 Mg CO2e less in \n2023 versus 2022. Since the beginning of the measurement, our portfolio avoided  \n53% Mg CO2e per million euros of revenue in 2023. \nThrough our regular Abris ESG Academy education program and by developing a \nmutual understanding of how important climate topics are for the success of portfolio \nbusinesses, we have created an outstanding community of managers promoting \nsustainability. And this comes on top of Abris itself achieving carbon neutrality in our \nWarsaw and Bucharest offices in 2023.\nAnother flagship initiative, the DEI Code, which was introduced in 2022 and executed \nthroughout 2023, continues to yield favourable outcomes. My satisfaction stems not only \nfrom the enhanced diversity metrics observed across all portfolio leadership teams but, \nmore significantly, from businesses\u2019 evident readiness to change. I am convinced that \nwe have successfully conquered the most significant obstacle we faced.\nI encourage you to read this 2023 ESG Report not only as a summary of our projects, \nachieved goals and calculated results, but especially as a testament to the tremendous \nwork done by our portfolio teams and my Abris colleagues. Every year we do this job with \none thing in mind \u2013 do better, go further and deliver more sustainable results for all our \nstakeholders. Thank you! \nSincerely,\nPawel Gierynski\nManaging Partner\n 6\n7\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nAbout us\n 8\n9\nAbris Capital Partners\nTHE FIRM\nOUR BUSINESS\nOUR PORTFOLIO COMPANIES\n17 \n3\n14 \n42\n1\n14,383 \n46% \n\u20ac1.3bn \n13 \n100% \n50\n52% \n3\n32\n10\n42\nactive portfolio companies\nexit\nof all employees are female\nfunds\nyears in the market\nindustry sectors\nadd-ons\ncarbon neutral\ninvestments\noffices\nESG working streams \nmonitored and measured\ninstitutional investors from \nEurope, the US and Australia\nof committed capital\nemployees\nemployees in our portfolio\nless emissions per  \nmillion euros of revenue  \nthan at the initial stage\nESG Report 2023     About us\nAbris Capital Partners is a private equity firm \ninvesting in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) \nand\u00a0creating value through ESG transformation. \nFounded in 2007, Abris specializes in mid-market \ninvestments, seeking opportunities in sectors such \nas specialty manufacturing, healthcare, circular \neconomy or e-commerce related technology across \nthe CEE region.

For us, there is \nno distinction between \u201cinvesting\u201d and \u201cresponsible \ninvesting\u201d. We have incorporated our Responsible \nInvestment Policy and our ESG Monitoring Procedure \ninto our investment process from due diligence all \nthe way through to exit, and beyond. Our Responsible \nInvestment Policy defines our responsibilities, presents \nour investment process path, and defines the rules of \ntransparency. \nWe actively engage with our portfolio companies \nthroughout the investment process and embed ESG \nissues into all stages of our plan for each investment. \nWe understand that only close, long-term cooperation \nwill lead to successful outcomes at each portfolio \ncompany.\nEvery year, we review and update our approach to ESG \nby implementing new policies, programs, tools, and \nobjectives. In 2023:\nAt Abris, we decided to use our capabilities to promote \nresponsible investment throughout the region. We \nshare our experience to ensure that private equity \nfunds across Central Europe \u2013 which is home to \naround 100 million people \u2013 increasingly take into \naccount environmental, social and governance fac-\ntors when making investment decisions. We consider \nourselves to be an ESG transformation specialist, \nsetting standards for the private equity industry across \nthe region.\nFrom compliance to value creation\nIn 2023 we developed the third edition of our ESG \nUniverse strategy. Over the past six years, we have \nimplemented the first two iterations, which have \nenabled us to create an ESG portfolio model that is \nnot only effective but also repeatable. We added two \nflagships to our methodology: measurement of the \nESG impact on the portfolio businesses (Data Harvest) \nand integration of sustainable risks and opportunities \ninto portfolio strategies (Experience Harvest).\nAs a result, under ESG Universe 2026 we will focus on \nintegrating sustainability trends into each portfolio \ncompany\u2019s strategy and establishing a correlation \nbetween ESG and financial performance. This will \nbe achieved using our proprietary methodology for \nmeasuring ESG-enabled EBITDA, and other analytical \nand reporting tools. Our new, comprehensive strategy \ntraditionally includes initiatives across governance \nand culture, education, standards and data. \nAbris ESG Universe 2026 - The third chapter of our evolution\nAbris ESG Universe: Evolution \n\u2022\t Define the Abris approach to \nESG integration (three pillars)\n\u2022\t Build the Framework, \nprocesses and procedures \n(prototyping, testing, prioritiz-\ning, ongoing learning)\n\u2022\t Educate the team \n(ESG Academy, Investment \nCommittee buy-in)\n\u2022\t Conduct disciplined port-\nfolio work and recognition \n(ESG\u00a0structures, yearly plans, \nESG Awards)\n\u2022\t Measure impact (ESG Scoring \nApplication, carbon footprint \nmanagement)\n\u2022\t Communicate proactively \nwith stakeholders (LPs, PRI, \nInvest Europe, PSiK etc)\n\u2022\t Continue to develop the \nthree-pillar approach \n(Internal ESG Governance)\n\u2022\t Add new procedures to \ndeepen sophistication of \nprocesses (Exit Scenario)\n\u2022\t Continue education in more \nsystemic way; integrate \nESG into evaluation system \n(ESG\u00a0Academy)\n\u2022\t Use Universe 2020 lessons \nlearned to improve efficiency \n(Management KPIs)\n\u2022\t Develop existing tools further \n(Value Enhancement Scoring \nApplication)\n\u2022\t Build comprehensive ESG \nreporting practice (Board \nPacks, quarterly and annual \nLP reports, ESG Report)\n\u2022\t Continue to develop existing ESG/\nBCorp framework and adapt to \nthe market regulatory develop-\nments\n\u2022\t Redirect internal ESG attitude and \ntools towards data-driven meth-\nodologies and targets\n\u2022\t Enhance portfolio strategies with \ninnovative sustainability and \ndigital trends, strengthen portfolio \nand fund\u2019s reporting with ESG data\n\u2022\t Support portfolio teams with ESG \nknowledge sharing and promoting \nbest practices (ESG Academy)\n\u2022\t Acknowledge Abris\u2019 status as sus-\ntainability champion and partner \nof choice for the LPS\n\u2022\t Promote ESG standards in the \nCE Region (BCorp, POLSIF, Invest \nEurope)\nObjectives:\nObjectives:\nObjectives:\n2020\nPlant  \nthe tree\u2026\n2023\nGrow the \nforest!\n2026\nHarvest!\nwe obtained B Corp status \n\u2013 the most prestigious, \nglobally recognized ESG \naccreditation for businesses \n\u2013 making us the only private \nequity firm in Central Europe \nwith B Corp certification\ndrawing on years of \nexperience, we established \nnew goals and documented \nthem in the ESG Universe \nStrategy 2026\nwe sought to better \ndemonstrate the impact of \nESG initiatives on the value \nof our portfolio companies \nby developing a unique \nmethodology for calculating \nESG-enabled EBITDA\nHarvest!\n 18\n19\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nThree pillars of Abris ESG philosophy\nESG Universe 2026 foundation\nSince 2017, Abris\u2019 ESG Universe Strategy has been \nbased on three pillars: \nPillar I \u2013 Abris as a model ESG organization:  \npresents Abris as a model organization for our portfolio \ncompanies and the private equity industry.\nPillar II \u2013 End-to-end ESG processes:  \nensures ESG processes form a key part of deci-\nsion-making at each stage of the investment process.\nPillar III \u2013 ESG thought leader:  \npositions Abris as an ESG leader across the CEE region \nthrough best-in-class reporting and the promotion of \nESG best practices.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are a global \ncommitment to build a more inclusive, resilient, and \nenvironmentally responsible world.

The certification signifies that \na company meets rigorous standards of social and \nenvironmental performance, transparency, and \naccountability. To become a Certified B Corporation, a \ncompany must undergo an assessment process that \nevaluates its impact on various stakeholders, including \nworkers, customers, communities, and the environ-\nment. The assessment covers areas such as govern-\nance, workers\u2019 treatment, community engagement, \nenvironmental practices, and overall business impact.\nWith a score of 108.4, Abris achieved results signifi-\ncantly better than the threshold required to achieve B \nCorp status.

This flagship program promotes best-in-\nclass diversity, equity and inclusion management \npractices across our portfolio. \nThe DEI Code sets out six key commitments, covering \neducation and setting the tone, governance, owner-\nship and process, and culminating with a commitment \nfrom Abris to take on the role of DEI leadership, pro-\nmoting inclusion across the private equity ecosystem. \nThe Code also encompasses DEI recommendations \nthat advisors and other contractors should adhere to \nwhen working with Abris.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all DEI approach for portfolio \ncompanies, therefore, as in previous flagship pro-\ngrams, we designed it as a roadmap for achieving the \nbest results at each portfolio company. \nc) Describe the resilience of \nthe organization\u2019s strategy, \ntaking into consideration \ndifferent climate-related \nscenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or \nlower scenario.\na) Describe the organization\u2019s \nprocesses for identifying and \nassessing climate-related \nrisks.\nb) Describe the organization\u2019s \nprocesses for managing \nclimate-related risks.\nc) Describe how processes \nfor identifying, assessing, and \nmanaging climate-related \nrisks are integrated into the \norganization\u2019s overall risk \nmanagement.\na) Disclose the metrics used \nby the organization to assess \nclimate-related risks and \nopportunities in line with its \nstrategy and risk manage-\nment process\nb) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, \nand, if appropriate, Scope 3 \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emis-\nsions, and the related risks\nRisk Management \u2013 recommended disclosure\nMetric and Targets \u2013 recommended disclosure\nThe six key commitments of the DEI Code: \n1.\t\nCreating a culture of \u201cDEI Readiness\u201d through education, \ninternal dialogue and the application of best market practices. \n2.\t Ensuring at least 30% of the underrepresented gender in the \ncomposition of supervisory boards and leadership of portfolio \ncompanies. \n3.\t Appointing the Chief People Officer (CPO) as a Management \nBoard member in each portfolio company to elevate HR and DEI \ntopics to the strategic level. \n4.\t Building formalised and transparent HR systems with industry \nrelevant DEI chapters in each portfolio company. \n5.\t Prioritising constant learning based on monitoring and reporting \nvia the ESG Scoring Application. \n6.\t Promoting DEI in the private equity ecosystem, taking leadership \non building DEI into relationships with advisors.\nEdgar Kolesnik \nPartner of\nAbris Capital Partners:\n\u201cI believe in diverse teams.  \nThis can be difficult to achieve at the \nbeginning, but the results can become \nmanagement tool. It can require you to \nstep outside of your comfort zone, but \nlong-term benefits are evident. In order to \nrepresent diversity at the strategic level  \nand create long-term value, companies \nmust appoint a Chief People Officer \ncharged with building and retaining the \ntalent pool. The CPO must be a part of the \nManagement Board, where she/he will \nact as an employee sponsor and change \nagent by anticipating HR-related needs.\u201d\n 26\n27\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nIn 2023 we delivered the first commitment of our DEI Code:  \nCreating a culture of \u201cDEI Readiness\u201d. \nTogether with the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Alliance \nand external experts we prepared a series of educa-\ntional videos: Abris DEI Talks. \nThese interviews present and explain the significance \nof various DEI aspects in building an engaged organ-\nizational culture and serve as an inspiration for the \nleaders to dive deeper into DEI advantages. We have \nshared these insights with our portfolio companies, \nemployees and the wider ecosystem.\nDEI Talks comprised seven films. In each episode, an \nexpert explains a specific people management related \nissue along with a practical example of its occurrence \nwithin the organization. The issues we discussed \nincluded: neurodiversity, biases, talent acquisition, \nefficient onboarding, leadership communication and \nDEI as a response to a crisis.\n1. Unlimited growth \nEvery individual has unique strengths, weaknesses, \nand aspirations. Organizations need to adapt their de-\nvelopment paths to meet individuals\u2019 needs but most \nof all benefit from specific individual talents. When \nemployees feel valued, respected, and included into \ndecision making, they are more likely to be engaged, \nmotivated, and productive.\nOur portfolio companies learned how organizations \ncreate an environment where employees can grow \nand develop their skills.\n2. Benefits of neurodiversity\nNeurodiversity describes the idea that people expe-\nrience and interact with the world in many different \nways. There is no \u201cright\u201d way of thinking, learning, \nand behaving, and differences cannot be viewed as \ndeficits.\nNeurodiversity might present a challenge for leaders \nand organizations, especially in everyday business \npractices, but can also be a source of conflict in \norganizations, stemming from differences in com-\nmunication styles. On the other hand, neurodiverse \nemployees often can contribute exceptional skills \nand talents enriching the overall competencies and \nknowledge capacity.\nOur expert explains the intricacies of neurodiversity in \nthe context of new business models, work methods, \nand digital transformation. \n3. We are all biased\nOur portfolio companies can ask themselves what \nspecific actions can be implemented in their company \nto increase diversity in order to support better deci-\nsion-making.\nIt is important to begin by acknowledging that we are \nall biased. We are not neutral. Each of us has our own \nexperiences and cultural backgrounds. Therefore, \nthere is no place where we can exist without biases. \nOur expert introduces the \u201csecond thought rule\u201d, which \nstates that by admitting that we all have biases, we \ncan give ourselves the time and the opportunity to \nmake a second evaluation that will be more objective.\n4. We need talents\nThe importance of DEI in talent acquisition is critical, \nand not merely from a compliance perspective. It is a \nstrategic imperative that positively impacts organi-\nzational performance, innovation capacity, employee \nengagement, and overall success in an increasingly \ndemanding and competitive business environment.\n5. Making onboarding efficient and building for \nthe future\nOnboarding is a magic moment when new employees \ndecide to stay engaged or become disengaged. An \ninclusive onboarding process contributes to a positive \nworkplace culture, increased employee satisfaction, \nand improved business outcomes. It is an investment \nin the long-term success an organization through \nleveraging the unique strengths and perspectives of a \ndiverse workforce. \n6. Communication is king, and queen\nAn inclusive communication embraces diversity, \nrespects individuals\u2019 differences, and ensures that \neveryone feels heard and valued. Open dialogue and \nactive listening are essential components of identify-\ning inclusive communication needs.\nGuiding principles for inclusive communication in busi-\nness includes: Respect and dignity; Clarity and simplic-\nity; Accessibility; Inclusive language; Active listening; \nEducation and training.\n7. Crisis is an opportunity\nDEI enables better responses to crises, but only if it is \nan integral part of the organizational culture. \nLeaders play a vital role in transforming a DEI crisis into \na learning process. It is essential for leaders to demon-\nstrate inclusive behaviors and champion diversity at \nall levels of the organization. By promoting transparen-\ncy, open communication, and accountability, leaders \ncan create a safe space for employees to voice their \nconcerns and ideas. Moreover, leaders should lead \nby example and actively seek feedback from their \nteams to ensure that the organization\u2019s DEI initiatives \nare aligned with the needs and aspirations of all their \nstakeholders. Individuals, leaders, teams, and whole or-\nganizations are compelled to find innovative solutions.\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring that the proportion of women \non the Board of Directors and Supervisory Board is no less \nthan 30%. We are proud that at the present moment, the \nlevel in both bodies is 50%. In addition, it is important for us to \nmaintain a minimum 40% share of women in management \npositions. In the recruitment process, we pay special attention \nto the diversity of our team formation. We believe that this is \nthe only way we can create a unique working environment, be \na competitive employer and achieve above-average results.\u201d \nMonika Bieszk \nDirector of Human Resources and Sustainability, \nBoard Member, DOT2DOT SA \n 28\n29\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nResponsible Investment \nManagement System\nAbris\u2019 Responsible Investment Policy defines respon-\nsibilities, presents our investment process path, and \nsets out the rules of transparency.

Our \ncriteria are based on the overarching principles of \nrespecting human rights and protecting the envi-\nronment. This means we do not invest in companies \ninvolved in areas such as: activities that contravene \nUN or EU conventions on fundamental rights such as \nchild labour, racial discrimination, trade embargoes \nor environmental protection; the production or trade \nof alcohol; the production or trade of tobacco; drift \nnet fishing using nets in excess of 2.5km in length; and \nmaterial / systemic corruption.\nLink: https://abris-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Abris- \nCapital-Partners_Exclusion-list.06.2022.pdf\n 32\n33\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nDue diligence\nBefore proceeding with due diligence, ESG catego-\nrization is carried out according to Abris\u2019 proprietary \nmethodology. The objective is to conduct a prelim-\ninary assessment of the company\u2019s key ESG risks, \nallowing us to decide the scope and focus of our ESG \ndue diligence and to select the most appropriate \nexternal due diligence providers. For the purposes of \ncategorization, the following data is collected: number \nof employees, human rights risks in the supply chain, \nand water and energy use. ESG due diligence is an \nintegral and mandatory element of Abris\u2019 investment \nprocesses.\nExit\nAt the start of each investment, Abris sets long-term \nobjectives in the form of an ESG Exit Path Model, as well \nas annual objectives. The Exit Path Model contains the \nESG goals that company should achieve by the time \nAbris exits its investment. Together with each portfolio \ncompany, we strive to achieve the best result \u2013 a \nscore of 100% implementation (see charts). The Exit \nPath Model is monitored throughout the investment \nlifecycle through action plans, KPIs, and reporting, \nand its status is updated by the Abris ESG Team every \nquarter and reviewed by the Investment Team  in the \nESG Scoring Application.\nTypical annual action-plan supported by \nthe\u00a0ESG Scoring Application\nDuring first quarter of each year, the ESG Team \nconducts its annual ESG analysis with each portfolio \ncompany. The analysis is based on site visits and \ninterviews with ESG Coordinators, CEOs, CFOs and \nemployees responsible for specific ESG topics within \neach portfolio company. During these visits, we use the \nScoring Application. Once complete, the company\u2019s \nrisk map is automatically updated, allowing us to iden-\ntify the most significant risks and the key ESG areas \nthat need to be addressed. After the ESG analysis, the \nESG Team \u2013 in cooperation with the Deal Team and \nmanagement board of the portfolio company \u2013 create \nan ESG Action Plan for the year. These plans are added \nto the Scoring Application and can be updated once \na quarter by the portfolio company\u2019s ESG Coordinator, \nas well as being reviewed during quarterly calls. ESG \ngoals are part of the annual KPIs for senior executives.\nThis methodology applies to 100% of our investment. \nMonitoring and value creation\nAbris ESG Scoring Application \nIn 2020, Abris launched its proprietary ESG Scoring Ap-\nplication software, which tracks more than 600 metrics \nat each portfolio company and allows us to measure \nand analyze ESG actions across our portfolio.

Whatever we do \nand whichever challenge, objective or task we decide to undertake, we carry \nfull responsibility for the results, protecting stakeholders\u2019 interests and super-\nvising the possible impact our actions may have. We will always go the extra \nmile, to make sure that the commitments or promises we make are accom-\nplished and that our deeds generate as much value as possible for the famous \n\u201c3P (People, Planet, Profit)\u201d. \nThe Responsible Investing concept has always been at the heart of our busi-\nness philosophy. We remain committed to strengthening the attention of the \nentire team on principles of Responsible Investing. We also consistently urge \nour portfolio companies to align their actions and strategies with our approach. \nOur ESG integration methodology, as discussed in Abris ESG 2020 Universe, \nis a complete program presenting our ambitions and setting very pragmatic \nand practical goals. Therefore, our choice of priorities for each year is driven \nprimarily by a desire to improve value creation, but also by our fundamentally \nrisk-based approach. In 2018, following both EU trends and regulatory focus, \nwe have concentrated on a broad implementation of our \u201czero tolerance\u201d \npolicy by implementing codes of ethical conduct, anti-corruption procedures \nand professional whistleblowing tools. We are happy with the results that \nyou will see presented in this report, but especially with the level of support \nreceived from the Abris team and our investee companies. Our commitment \nto make a real change is rock-solid. \nIn 2019, we will continue doing our utmost to professionalize through institut-\ning new projects within the governance area. I hope to present some interest-\ning achievements in our next year\u2019s report, but I also hope to share some of our \nbest practices with the PE community in Central and Eastern Europe.\nThis will go hand-in-hand with several initiatives launched by governmental \nauthorities in the CEE region, which is on track to deliver not only outstanding \neconomic growth, but also major changes in corporate governance and the \nprofessional standards of doing business. I am sure it will be another interesting \nESG year for all of us here!\nI would like to sincerely thank our Abris team for their hard work on integrat-\ning ESG in their daily schedules and our portfolio managers for their buy-in to \nthe idea. Special gratitude goes also to our limited partners for your support \nand feedback.

Therefore, Abris \nis a signatory of the Principles for Responsible \nInvestment (\u201cPRI\u201d) and has used it\u2019s Six Principles \nas a framework for developing ESG policy across \nall of our investment activities. Since December \n2018, Abris has also been committed to the UN \nGlobal Compact corporate responsibility initia-\ntive and its principles in the areas of human rights, \nlabor, environment and anti-corruption. Our ESG \nteam members are regularly contributing to the \nprojects and initiatives of both organizations, \nwinning broad recognition throughout the com-\nmunity.\nAbris stands as a link between global investors \nand regional companies. Both the Six Principles of \nthe PRI and the Ten Principles of the UN Global \nCompact inspire us to transform ideas of sustain-\nable development and responsible investment \ninto practice. \nWe support the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. In 2015, all United Nations \nMember States committed to 17 Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) to help us all end \nextreme poverty, fight inequality & injustice, and \nfind solutions to climate change. We have a role to \nplay in achieving these goals for a more pros-\nperous, equitable, and sustainable world. Abris \nstrives to contribute to the SDGs through its own \nactivities and those of the portfolio companies. \nTherefore, selected activities of portfolio com-\npanies will be further presented in the context of \nachieving these goals.\nOur responsibility and impact\nAbris, as an institutional investor, has a duty to act in the \nbest long-term interests of its beneficiaries. \nIn this fiduciary role, we believe that environmen-\ntal, social, and corporate governance initiatives \ncan beneficially affect the performance of invest-\nment portfolios and mitigate various risks. As a so-\ncially responsible investor, we invest in companies \nthat act responsibly in terms of ESG; therefore, \nour decision-making process includes several \nmilestones related to ESG risk evaluation. \nWe are aware of our economic, social and \nenvironmental impact, especially through the \noperations of our portfolio companies. Our ESG \napproach supports the circular economy goals of \ngradually reducing consumption of finite resourc-\nes and eliminating systems waste while transition-\ning to renewable energy sources. This represents \na systemic shift that builds long-term resilience, \ngenerates business and economic opportunities, \nand provides environmental and societal benefits. \nWe work to build economic and social value in \nour investments through close collaboration and \ngenuine respect for our business partners.\nWe believe good and effective corporate gov-\nernance, with a professional ESG approach is a \nprerequisite to building strong companies and, \nultimately, maximizing shareholder value. We \nactively engage with our portfolio companies \nthroughout the investment process and insist \non embedding ESG issues in all steps along the \nway. The businesses in which we invest must be \ncognizant of the social impact and environmental \nconsequences arising from their operations.\n20%\nThe scale of our impact is reflected in the following results:\naverage EBITDA CAGR \nover the last 5 years\nof total portfolio sales\n\u20ac1.5bn\nemployees in our  \nportfolio companies\nnew jobs created in our \nportfolio companies \nunder our stewardship\n\u20ac1.2bn\nof committed capital\nMore than\n12,500\n1,700+\n Abris as a responsible investor \nABRIS CAPITAL PARTNERS\n17\nAbris as a responsible investor \nESG REPORT 2018\n16\nESG End to End Investment Process\nWe have incorporated our Responsible Invest-\nment Policy and our ESG Monitoring Procedure \nfully into our investment process. From initial due \ndiligence to Investment Committee approvals, to \npost-investment monitoring, ESG considerations \nare evaluated throughout the process as we work \nclosely with our portfolio companies in develop-\ning their ESG policies and procedures. Once an \ninvestment is made, we continue monitoring ESG \nrisks to ensure the interests of our limited partners \nare well protected.\nPre-acquisition stage\nESG standards are formally incorporated into \nour investment due diligence process. The Deal \nLeaders are responsible for reviewing all potential \ninvestment targets from a corporate responsibility \nperspective in order to understand the profile and \npotential ESG risks of each company. \nEvery potential portfolio company is checked \nagainst the Abris Exclusion List, based on all \ncontractual terms included in our LPAs. Abris will \nnever invest in companies on the Exclusion List. \nDuring analysis of a target company, Investment \nTeams are assisted by ESG colleagues in deter-\nmining the scope of ESG due diligence to be \nperformed. It is based on Categorization Guide-\nlines developed by Abris, to ascertain the relevant \ncomplexity of ESG Due Diligence.\nFollowing the ESG Due Diligence, ESG advisors \nsubmit reports to the Investment and ESG Teams \nfor further discussion. In the event that material \nenvironmental issues are revealed in a red flag re-\nport, the Investment Committee is then notified. \nIf the Deal is approaching the ultimate investment \nstage, a final report is provided and reviewed. A \nDeal Qualifying Memorandum with an ESG action \nplan is presented to the Investment Committee. \nThe plan is further developed into one section of \nthe post-investment 100-day plan.\nESG 2020 Universe - The path we are on\nIn 2017, the Abris management team made a \nclear commitment to strengthen our responsible \ninvesting policies and to develop Abris ESG 2020 \nUniverse.

Abris\u2019 ESG \nTeam works closely with both ESG Coordinators \nand their teams.\nIn order to assure comprehensive analysis and \nevaluation of ESG integration in portfolio compa-\nnies, we have built a proprietary ESG Scoring tool \nand evaluation methodology.\nESG Scoring allows us to measure risk, manage-\nment practices and indicators in ten areas: corpo-\nrate governance, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, \nhuman resources, health & safety, human rights, \nenvironment, sanction & anti-trust, IT & cyber se-\ncurity, product/service safety, and marketing. The \nAbris ESG Scoring utilizes more than 350 meas-\nures to help us conduct in-depth ESG analyses.\nThe Abris ESG Scoring tool is used to identify ESG \nrisks and measure implementation progress on an \nannual basis.

The Company considers \nGDPR to be extremely important in a number of ways. Firstly, the \nregulations on protection of personal data affect practically every \nlevel of our business activity. Ensuring the security of personal \ndata for the Company\u2019s customers and employees will enable us \nto avoid the risk of incurring high financial penalties. The Com-\npany approached this task comprehensively. In June and July \n2018, an audit was carried out by an external party. Based on the \ncollected data, our existing security features and the recommen-\ndations derived from the audit report, we created a security policy \nfor personal data processing. Prior to and during the preparation \nfof the finalized security policy, the Company undertook early \nactions to ensure appropriate data security. Following GDPR \nemployee training, in October the Management Board adopted \nthe new security policy. Shortly thereafter, all employees received \ngeneral information on the changes and the range of responsibili-\nties, recommendations and documents needed.\nDue to the specific nature of the GDPR, the Company continually \nundertakes activities to ensure a high level of data protection.\nCASE STUDY\nGOAL 16\nESG activities  \nin 2018\nAs President of Industrial Division , I consider ESG to be a necessary \nand helpful tool. It allows us to judge the company from non-finan-\ncial point of view.

The selec-\ntion process continued the \nCompany\u2019s strategy from \nprevious years to prioritize \nthe support for youth from \nLower Silesia. The Com-\npany has signed agree-\nments with these entities \nto establish the terms of \nsponsorship.\n \nIndustrial Division, owner of the Cargounit brand, has been op-\nerating on the market since 2003. The Company\u2019s activity is the \nacquisition, rental and maintenance of rolling stock. The Company \nwas established on the basis of Polish capital. It is one of the largest \nROSCO companies operating in Europe and one of the few Polish \nentities offering a rolling stock lease operating independently of \nthe vehicle manufacturer. Cargounit specialize in the petrochemi-\ncal industry as well as in transport of raw materials and specializes \ncargo. The Company owns also Powerunit brand. Cargounit applies \nto freight transport vehicles while Powerunit refers to vehicles used \nfor passenger transport.\nCARGOUNIT\nFleet management policy\nThe Fleet management \npolicy was finalized in 2018 \nand the final draft has been \nagreed with the legal and \nfinancial department.

This is to prevent \nany possible conflict of \ninterest or corruption. That \nis why we have introduced a \nwhistleblowing mechanism \nand monitoring of proce-\ndures along with it.\nEnvironmental \nimprovements\nAs a production facility, the \nenvironmental standards are \nvery important for us. We \nstrive hard to optimize pro-\nduction processes so as not \nto contribute to environmen-\ntal pollution. For example, \nwe limit consumption of \nelectricity in the produc-\ntion hall by using LED bulbs \nand eliminate the alcohol \nused during production with \nbuffers that reduce alcohol \nconsumption by 50%. What\u2019s \nmore, we are gradually work-\ning on optimizing each pro-\nduction process individually \nso we can optimize each of \nour packaging processes. We \nalso take care when sourcing \nour paper by only purchasing \nproduct with PEFC and FSC \ncertificates.\nCASE STUDY\nFor us at Dot2Dot group, sustainable development and social \nresponsibility are a strategic issue. We consider our actions in these \nareas as part of our competitive advantage. Dot2Dot does not rely \nsolely on traditional financial statements. Non-financial issues are \nalso an extremely important factor in our decision-making. We \nstrive to build our values in a sustainable, but also long-lasting, way. \nThat is why managing our company\u2019s development and corporate \ngovernance is so important to us. We are proud of the values and \nstandards by which we operate.\u201d\nKrzysztof Ros\u0142aniec \nCEO Dot2Dot\nSupport and supplementary programs for our employees are \nimportant to us. We are proud of the Dot4Development project, \nconsisting of three pillars: Leadership, Basic and Talent Manager. \nIn the second half of the year we also introduced work-life-bal-\nance training. Another program we are developing is the Ambition \nPlan, which is directly connected to the bonus program.\nAs the proverb says, \u201cSecurity is not everything, but without se-\ncurity everything is nothing.\u201d One of the top priorities of Dot2Dot \nmanagement is building a safety culture. Shaping the culture \nitself is a dynamic process, because changing habits, beliefs or \nbehaviors is often a challenge. It requires time and a professional \napproach. Therefore, at the beginning of the year, SEKA S.A. took \nover the coordination of health and safety processes as well as fire \nprotection and obligatory employee training in that area.\nIt is important for us to support young, ambitious people. That is \nwhy we are launching the Practical Apprenticeship program. It en-\ntails cooperation with a technical school in Tarn\u00f3w Podg\u00f3rne, near \nBator\u00f3w. Under expert supervision, students will acquire practical \nknowledge about our profession. We are proud that we can share \nour knowledge with young people.\nAttractive employer\nDot2Dot is a leader in the printing industry in Poland, employing \nnearly 700 people in four locations. Our clients can take advantage \nof a one-stop-shop for a wide range of packaging options and inno-\nvative design solutions, including our top quality multi-color print-\ning, luxury packaging expertise, unique packaging constructions, \nembossing & lamination and 3-D effects.

The project idea \narose from meetings with \nemployees regarding prob-\nlems encountered in the \nworkplace and discussions \non finding solutions. The \nformer system employed \noperators handling around \n680 -1120 kg per shift using \ntwo employees and forklift. \nThe new system enables \nworkers to more easily \nhandle heavy weights, as \nthe effort is transferred \nto an automated system, \nrequiring only one opera-\ntor, that retrieves the big \nroles and places them onto \npallets. The reduction in \nphysical effort also greatly \ndecreases the risks of ac-\ncidental injury.\nH&S project upgrading \nthe thermosetting oven \nto decrease or eliminate \nfire risk\nFollowing the fire in our \nfiber section oven in 2017 \n(from the self-ignition of \nmaterials), we changed the \noven and installed a steam \ninstallation to limit or extin-\nguish a fire inside the oven. \nAlso, we added an alert sys-\ntem consisting of 10 lamps, \nan acoustic warning and 8 \nfire alerting buttons to send \nan alarm to staff in case of \nan oven fire.

Historically, water consumption fluctu-\nated between 2.9 and 2.2 liters per can. Management set a goal of \nreducing water consumption to 1 liter per can.\nOne of our first steps was to set up a team to analyse all available \ndata. This prompted a management decision to increase the num-\nber of measurement points for water consumption, measure these \npoints manually and save the measurement data to a searchable \narchive. New tools from the Lean management group were used \nfor the project data analysis.\nAfter identifying the largest points of consumption, we conducted \na second round of analysis to ascertain the most effective solu-\ntions for reducing water consumption. Several machines were \nselected to be either upgraded or replaced. The plant\u2019s middle \nmanagement received training on reducing water consumption \nand a portion of the maintenance team\u2019s cleaning and disinfection \ntools were replaced. \nWithin five months of initiating the project, we reached our goal of \nonly 1.2 liters per can. The year ended with an average of 1.07 liters \nper can. During this time, we saved approximately PLN 1.9m of \nbudgeted costs for the water and wastewater segment.

As a \nsuccessful business, we \nheavily rely on our manage-\nment team and employ-\nees. The formal Code of \nConduct, as well as the \nanti-corruption policy, will \nbe a helpful guide in our \neveryday business endeav-\nors. There are many situa-\ntions that may raise ethical \nconcerns. We want to study \nvarious business situations \nto help us in distinguishing \nbetween actions or behav-\niors that fall within accept-\nable business standards \nand those that go beyond \nthese standards. This is also \nimportant within the con-\ntext of upcoming changes \nto legal regulations found \nin the Act on the Liabilities \nof Collective Entities.\nWe find that comprehen-\nsive employee trainings \nin preparing necessary \ndocuments and standards \nare a very important part of \nthis process. To effectively \ncounteract undesirable \nbehaviors or situations, we \nneed ensure that everyone \nat Velvet Care understands \nthe kind of activities that \nare deemed unacceptable. \nThese efforts naturally re-\nquire that appointment of \na Compliance Officer and \na Compliance Committee, \nas well as, the implementa-\ntion of the whistleblow-\ning procedure. We are \nconvinced that eliminating \nundesirable behaviors is a \ncritical element in building \nan organizational culture \nbased on universal and \nshared values. This step is \nnecessary for us to grow \nas an organization and to \nfurther extend the scope of \nour business activities.\nWe see it as the main priority of our business. That is why we are \nalready taking major steps in the first year of our cooperation with \nAbris. We perceive ESG as an important tool for building the Com-\npany\u2019s value and as an integral part of the long-term \u201cVelvet CARE \n2023\u201d strategy. To a large extent, these standards have already \nbeen in existence in Velvet Care for a long time. A comprehensive, \nproprietary project approach provides us with a great opportunity \nto systematize ESG activities and supplement quickly any deficits \nin this area. Our priorities in 2019 are to implement code of ethical \nconduct and an anti-corruption policy, together with appointing a \nCompliance Officer and Compliance Committee. We will also be \nimplementing a new whistleblowing procedure.\u201d\nArtur Pielak\nCEO Velvet CARE\nIn 2018, Velvet CARE initiated and successfully completed the \nproject to reduce gas emissions to the atmosphere. Our responsi-\nbilities concerning this aspect of our business led us to shut down \nthe coal-fired boiler linked with the MP6 paper machine and \ndiscontinue using external energy sources, opting to install both a \ngas-fired boiler and our own steam energy sources. \nWith these changes we have significantly reduced the emission of \ngases and air polluters such as SO , NOx, Co2, PM10 and PM2,5 into \nthe atmosphere. The effects are very encouraging. SO2 emissions \nhave been reduced by 98% and CO2 emissions by 42%. The gas \nboiler room has significantly decreased annual atmospheric emis-\nsions by 38 tones in case of SO2, by 32 tones of NOx and by 7,350 \ntones of CO2. These numbers are related to the manufacturing of \ncellulose tissue at the MP6 paper machine, operating since 1976. \nThe gas-fired boiler project for the MP6 paper machine was com-\npleted in 2018. The new boiler house was built nearby to eliminate \nlosses from energy transfer. To sum up, switching to modern tech-\nnology has allowed to reduce gas & air pollution emission and re-\nduce heat loss while simultaneously benefiting from energy costs \nsavings. In general, the Company\u2019s thermal energy consumption \ndeclined by 18% within the first year!\nAs a leading cellulose tissue manufacturer in the CEE region, \nVelvet CARE is enthusiastic about implementing environmentally \nfriendly solutions. We are proud of meeting the EU Ecolabel crite-\nria and maintaining the EU Ecolabel certificate.\nGas-fired boiler and own \nsteam energy sources\nVelvet CARE is a leading manufacturer of cellulose hygiene goods \nincluding tissues, toilet rolls, kitchen rolls. The paper factory, located \nin Klucze in the south of Poland, has been in operation since 1897. \n\u201cVelvet\u201d is an iconic brand, positioned as the undisputable branded \nmarket leader in Poland. Velvet CARE is also an important supplier \nof Private Label products for the entire CEE and DACH regions. \nFrom 2013 to 2018, the Company implemented 3 strategic projects \nvalued at PLN 250m, including the installation of 6 new production \nlines, the construction of a new warehouse and, most importantly, \none of the most technically advanced paper machine available. \nThereby doubling manufacturing capacity to the level of 100,000 \ntons of cellulose tissue annually. The Company has doubled its \nturnover and added around 300 new employees during past three \nyears.\nVelvet CARE\nESG activities  \nin 2018\nFUND III\n 51\n50\nAbout the company\nPortfolio overview\nPortfolio overview\nGOAL 8\n\u201c\nGDPR\nWDX S.A. established a \nspecialist position to man-\nage GDPR, with continual \nsupport by an outside law \nfirm. The Company has a \npersonal data protection \npolicy in place and all em-\nployees are obliged to un-\ndergo training in this area. \nPersonal data processing \nagreements are signed with \nall our contractors and kept \nfully up-to-date. Each new \nproject undergoes compli-\nance consultations with the \nGDPR specialist.\nCASE STUDY\nFor many years now, when developing our strategies, we have been \nfocusing on maximizing the profits of the Company and its share-\nholder value. But we also focus on environmental protection, social \ninterests and relations with other stakeholder groups. Today, our \nlong-term strategy is to emphasize two main areas:\n\u203a\tFurther improving corporate governance, business ethics and \nworking conditions, as well as opportunities for our employees, \nour most valuable asset, to develop their skills. \n\u203a\tEnvironmental protection through the introduction of standards \nand modern technologies which allow us to reduce pollutant \nemissions and decrease generated waste and to provide proper \nrecycling methodologies.\nOne of our most important tools, in conjunction with the afore-\nmentioned projects, is the implementation of an integrated quality \nmanagement system, including the following standards: ISO 14001 \nenvironmental management system, ISO 9001 quality management \nsystem, OHSAS 18001 occupational health and safety management \nsystem.\u201d\nDariusz B\u0105kowski \nCEO WDX S.A.\nOccupational safety is an important area of operations for any \nenterprise. We set out twenty-three goals for 2018. Eigtheen tasks \nwere completed In total and 4 projects remain in various stages \nof implementation (15% to 75% completed). First aid training was \none of our completed projects. More than 60 people received \ntraining during this course. The training put a strong emphasis on \nthe practical application of first aid techniques, thereby preparing \ntrainees to take the correct measures in the event of an accident. \nWe have since seen their new skills reflected in the workplace ac-\ncident severity rate, which fell 35% from 49 in 2017 to 32 in 2018.\nAnother project that improved both worker safety and fire protec-\ntion was the removal of the explosion hazard zone from the paint \nshop. In this project, the existing paint and lacquer warehouse \nlocated next to the spray booth was permanently closed. In its \nplace, the main chemical warehouse was created. Thanks to a new \nefficient ventilation system, the explosion hazard zone has been \ncompletely eliminated.\nThe old spray gun washing station was replaced by an explosion-\nproof automatic washing station, significantly improving fire \nsafety during washing and eliminating employees\u2019 exposure to \nchemicals. The aforementioned activities by the Company have \ngreatly contributed to increased workplace safety and a reduced \nfire hazard.\nImproving worker \nsafety\nWDX S.A. manufactures and supplies integrated solutions for \nwarehouse equipment & storage and designs logistics systems for \ninternal transport. The Company has an in-house design office, \nR&D department and a modern handling system manufacturing \nplant. The plant has an area of 20,503m2 and a production capacity \nof 30,000 tons of steel per year, fabricating innovative conveyors \nand warehouse racks. Additionally, the Company distributes and \nprovides maintenance services for Crown, Doosan and Combilift \nforklift trucks. \nWDX S.A. brings many years\u2019 experience, coupled with an enormous \nproduction capacity, to the implementation of comprehensive \nsystem solutions and the creation of modern and fully automated \nwarehouses.

The \nproject is being imple-\nmented in cooperation with \nthe Silesian University of \nTechnology.\nAnti-corruption and \nwhistleblowing program\nWDX S.A. places a strong \nemphasis on legal compli-\nance in all of its business \noperations. To minimize \nthe risk of a breach, the \nManagement Board ap-\npointed a Compliance Of-\nficer whose role is to ensure \ncompliance with the Com-\npany\u2019s internal regulations \nand to manage the risk \nof non-compliance.

Even if it often stayed open late, this door would create a separation between \nthe two worlds, allowing us to clear our minds and focus on work while in the office \nand on rest, relaxation and family time when at home. \nCovid-19 and compulsory lockdowns suddenly made this door disappear, and the \ntwo worlds collided. Many things changed. Our desks suddenly landed in our kitch-\nens and living rooms, and we found ourselves answering emails 24/7, our screens al-\nways on and our mobile phones glued to our palms. We got used to working through \na small window, endlessly repeating \u201cyou are on mute\u201d, and we were unexpectedly \nintroduced to our colleagues\u2019 pets and kids. Meanwhile our suits and ties gathered \ndust in our wardrobes. \nWhile many people coped with the changes, lockdown had a troubling impact on \nmental health, with a marked increase in the rates of depression and suicide. In \naddition, thousands of jobs were lost, with knock-on effects on personal wealth, \nconsumer behavior and retail performance. These changes affected the business \nenvironment we operate in and imposed an entirely new approach to leadership, \nmanagement and everyday human relations. Therefore, if I were to pick one word to \ndescribe what was critical for us last year, it would be AGILITY.\nOur ESG focus in 2020 shifted strongly towards the social and crisis management \naspects. Together with our portfolio management teams, we designed and imple-\nmented sophisticated health protection procedures for all employees, polished and \ndeveloped our existing Business Continuity Plans, and trained portfolio companies in \ncrisis communication. I was genuinely amazed by the hundreds of hours our teams \nspent supporting CEOs and portfolio company leadership, defending their busi-\nnesses in what were extremely challenging conditions. Today, I can firmly say that \nwe understand the dynamics of market crises much better, and our toolkits to fight \ntheir consequences are now far more comprehensive. And most importantly, all our \nportfolio companies survived, maintained healthy cashflows and keep growing.\nI am also proud to announce that we have just launched a new ESG strategy for \nAbris \u2013 ESG Universe 2023. It is a continuation and development of our 2020 Universe \nproject, during which we found that our assumptions and approach were proved \ncorrect. We have learned an enormous amount from our work along the way, and \nwe used this expertise to add new projects and go further than ever before. \nESG Universe 2023 provides a comprehensive, overarching structure for all our work \nin this area. It encompasses 17 separate, but linked, projects across four key catego-\nries: governance and culture, standards; education; and carbon neutrality.\nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nSince carbon footprint reduction is the most \ncritical mission for all management teams \nworldwide, we want Abris to be a frontrunner \nfor private equity in the Central Europe region. \nAlong with our long-term commitment to \nexecute SDG 13 (Climate Action), our ambition \nis to deliver a net-zero carbon balancing \nmodel for the portfolio by 2025 \u2013 becoming the \nfirst private equity firm in the region to commit \nto carbon neutrality. \nIn 2017, when we launched our ESG Universe \n2020, we planted the tree. Today, we are ready \nto grow the forest. \nIn addition to their work in ESG, I am also glad to report that our Value Enhance-\nment Team has been kept very busy in 2020. Szymon and Tomasz, who joined Abris \nrecently, are devoting a lot of their time to building the value of our investments by \nimplementing an efficient internal controls framework, strengthening cybersecurity \nand by boosting digitalization across our portfolio. \nI hope readers will appreciate the 2020 edition of our ESG report and the work \nwe have done during the year, never giving up on our strategy\u2019s key principles of \ninvesting responsibly and efficiently, despite the challenging circumstances. I want \nto express my warm thanks to the entire Abris team and our best-in-class manage-\nment teams for their exceptional work and true commitment throughout the year, \nas well as to our investors, without whom none of this would be possible.

Now, we are building upon this expand-\ned expertise to analyze, adapt, add new projects and \ntake our ESG work further and deeper than ever before.\nESG Universe 2023 utilizes a three pillars approach to \nestablish a sustainable, proprietary program encom-\npassing 17 new initiatives within four key categories: \nGovernance and Culture, Standards, Education and \nCarbon Neutrality. \nThe strategy embodies the clear purpose of supporting \nrisk mitigation and value creation across the Abris \nportfolio, achieving a carbon neutral portfolio by \n2025 and establishing net-zero action plans for each \nindividual portfolio company.  \n Abris Capital Partners\n21\n20\nESG Report 2020  |  Abris as a responsible investor\nSince carbon footprint re-\nduction is the most important \nmission for all management \nteams across the world, \nwe want Abris to be a front \nrunner in this area for private \nequity in the Central Europe \nregion. Our ambition is to \ndeliver a net-zero carbon bal-\nancing model for the portfolio \nby 2025.\nOver the coming years, \nclimate change will strongly \nimpact every operating \nmodel and every industry \nacross the world. Our objec-\ntive is to make sure all our \nportfolio companies adapt \nto this reality in a sustainable \nway and actively participate \nin reducing carbon emissions \naccording to the EU Green \nDeal framework. The 2030 \ntarget will be embedded in \nour portfolio actions.\nWe will promote carbon \nneutrality in the investment \nindustry by participating in \ninitiatives with stakeholders, \npublishing guides and sharing \nbest practices.\nThe Abris commitment to a \ncarbon neutral portfolio by 2025\nNew focus of the ESG Universe\nOur ability to mitigate climate challenges effectively \nplays an important role in our investment approach. \nWe are committed to successfully transitioning to a \nlow-carbon economy and providing long-term stability \nfor our portfolio companies. Abris measures ESG risk \njust as thoroughly as we analyze traditional market \nmetrics. Our ESG approach is comprised of three focus \nareas to outline our direction and our aims.\nOversight\nWe have designed an impressive \narray of tools and metrics to ana-\nlyze our environmental impact and \nbuild resilient strategies to reduce it \ngoing forward.\nResources\nWe are steadily transitioning \ntoward a comprehensive selection \nof off-set and reduction initiatives \nincluding recyclable materials in \npackaging, reducing landfill waste, \nstreamlining supply chain logistics \nand stewarding water resources.\nClimate change\nWe have heavily invested in climate \nchange-related topics influencing \nthe value of our investments since \n2019. In 2020, we embarked upon \na new goal to become carbon \nneutral by 2025. \nThe portfolio companies conduct risk analysis at the \nmanagement and operational levels. Each company \nreports visible risks and assesses their importance. \nAfter estimating the impact and probability of these \nrisks, appropriate corrective actions are agreed by \nAbris and the company. The list of risks is reviewed and \nupdated annually.\nA quarter of global emissions are now under car-\nbon-pricing schemes and the number is rising. We \nare completing climate resilience and CO2 reduction \nstrategies for each portfolio company by the end of \n2021. In our Risk and Opportunities Assessment Tool, \neach risk has an assigned impact on EBITDA. Thanks to \nthis, we can determine the extent of the costs of risk \nmanagement and include it in our financial planning.\nOur ESG efforts align with the EU Taxonomy on sus-\ntainable activities \u2013 a guide to transparent climate \ndisclosures from the financial sector. It helps investors \nunderstand which activities are environmentally \nsustainable and how to best navigate the transition to \na low-carbon economy. \nThe Taxonomy Regulation sets out the legal obligations \nfor financial market participants regarding the disclo-\nsure of sustainability risks and impacts. But failure to \nmeet the taxonomy obligations has wider implications. \nIf a company does not meet disclosure obligations, \nit may not be considered \u201cinvestable.\u201d At that point, \na range of obstacles could result, e.g., higher cost of \ncapital, a reduced valuation or a problematic sale \nscenario.\nWe designed the Abris Climate Change Strategy to \nfulfill all EU regulatory requirements. With the help of our \nESG Exit Scenario Model, our portfolio companies will \nmeet all obligations and regulations by the end of 2021. \nOur practical approach is based on precisely meas-\nuring the carbon footprint of all companies in the \nportfolio, followed by emissions reduction action plans \nand a catalog of validated offset initiatives, enabling \nthe portfolio to reach neutrality in 2025. To ensure the \nprogram is fundamentally focused on real reductions \nrather than offsets, over the course of each year Abris \nwill invest in further emission-reduction projects, \nmeaning each individual company will reach net-zero \nwithin the EU timeframe.\nAbris has tasked each of its portfolio companies not \nonly with reducing emissions, but also with adapting \ntheir strategies and operating models to climate \nchange, which, for some businesses, may have dest-\nabilizing effects. Therefore, it is critical to run in-depth \nanalysis and adaptation programs for each one.\nOur ambitious climate neutral goal is based on our \nprior accomplishments: \n\u2022\tPrepared a carbon footprint calculation tool in Scope \n1 and 2 \n\u2022\tPrepared an analysis tool for climate change-related \nrisks and opportunities based on the Task Force on \nClimate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\u2022\tTrained portfolio companies on carbon footprint and \nclimate-related risk and opportunities\n\u2022\tMeasured the carbon footprint in all our portfolio \ncompanies in 2020\n\u2022\tOur portfolio companies began work on emissions \nreduction plans and climate change actions relevant \nto their strategies and operations.\nCarbon \nneutrality\nEducation\nWe plan to build an extensive \nESG knowledge base for the \nAbris team and invest more in \ntheir education.\nOur portfolio teams have \nproven their strong com-\nmitment to excel in building \nregional industry champions. \nIn order to support them \nwhile facilitating access to \nknowledge sharing, we want \nto invest in better tools and \noffer open access to our ESG \nknow-how.\nWe strongly believe in the \npower of responsibility. \nTherefore, everything we do \naims to improve the quality \nand value of our ESG impact. \nThese activities will be openly, \ntransparently shared with our \nstakeholders. We will seek new \nopportunities for sharing our \nknowledge and experience \nwith a broader audience, \npro-actively promoting ESG \nstandards. We also hope to \nopen our ESG Academy to \nother regional PE players.\n\u201cCarbon Pricing Dashboard,\u201d The World Bank, 27 March, 2021, \nhttps://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/\n Abris Capital Partners\n23\nOur ESG pillars are \nguiding principles \nfor the Universe \n2023\nThe world emits around 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse \ngases each year. Greenhouse gas emissions mostly \ncome from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, \nand natural gas, to produce electricity (25 percent of 2019 \ngreenhouse gas emissions), as well as from chemical, \nmetallurgical, and mineral transformation processes \n(23\u00a0percent of 2019 greenhouse gas emissions).\n Abris Capital Partners\n25\n24\nESG Report 2020  |  Our ESG pillars are guiding principles for the Universe 2023\nThe first pillar of our ESG strategy ensures that Abris is \na model organization for both our portfolio companies \nand the wider private equity ecosystem. We will always \nimplement and optimize each procedure ourselves, at \nAbris, before requesting that others adopt it.\nMeeting this goal requires three main elements that we \ndeveloped in 2020:\n\u2022\tTeam \u2013 experts committed to driving the entire process\n\u2022\t\t\nEducation \u2013 allowing us to continuously develop and \nshare our skills and knowledge\n\u2022\tPortfolio Corporate Governance \u2013 clear rules of \noperation and communication between decision \nmaking bodies \nOur Team\nThe ESG Team, as a part of the Value Enhancement \nTeam, is focused on delivering best-in-class ESG solu-\ntions and tools to the organization. Continuous support \nfrom and dialog with the Investment Committee and \nPartners Board illustrates the team\u2019s importance to \nAbris\u2019 strategy and investors\u2019 requirements.\nThe Value Enhancement Team works to support Deal \nTeams in risk management and value creation. The \nprimary areas supported by the Value Enhancement \nTeam include ESG, portfolio risk management and \nbusiness digitization. The team\u2019s main objectives are:\n\u2022\tProviding the time and resources necessary to sup-\nport Deal Teams\u2019 value creation for each investment\n\u2022\tBuilding an investment and portfolio experience \ndatabase\n\u2022\tContinuous professionalization of Abris Capital \nPartners\u2019 activities\nInternal ESG governance structure\nBuilding additional value using ESG is a joint effort \nbetween Abris and the portfolio companies. That is why \nAbris has extensive ESG policies and procedures, with \nmilestones and goals shared among the Investment \nCommittee, Investment Team and ESG Team. Further-\nmore, each company has its own ESG team and each \nCEO acts as a sponsor of these initiatives.\nCorporate governance\nCorporate governance is the backbone of an effective \nESG management system. That is why in 2020, we \nfocused on executing efficient implementation of the \nAbris Corporate Governance Model in each of our \nportfolio companies.\nThe primary goal was to strengthen standards of \ncorporate governance across all of the portfolio. We \nconstantly strive to perfect our governance system as, \nabove all, it helps to build a transparent, reliable and \nsustainable corporate culture. We also recognize that \nproper governance:\n\u2022\tAdds value to our investments, both through better, \nquantifiable performance (e.g., lower cost of pro-\ncurement) and through qualitative measures, such \nas increased valuation multiples (as a result of lower \nrisk of irregularities, increased transparency, ease of \nownership transfer or post-acquisition integration) \n\u2022\tAllows for a clear segregation of duties and com-\npetence among different corporate bodies and \ncreates transparent channels of communication \nand escalation.\n\u2022\tConstitutes a very effective defense mechanism \nagainst possible defects or crimes that might be \ncommitted, or appear to be, within our portfolio \ncompanies or externally, but with the participation of \ntheir employees. \nAbris assures consistency of main corporate govern-\nance procedures such as:\n\u2022\tAnti-corruption program\n\u2022\tWhistleblowing\n\u2022\tEqual Treatment and Diversity Policies\n\u2022\tCompliance Manual \u2013 polices & operating proce-\ndures\nEducation\nBy continually building knowledge through ongoing ed-\nucation, we are better able to innovate, solve problems \nand make higher quality decisions. That is why we have \nbeen developing Abris ESG Academy for several years. \nWe organize trainings and workshops for Investment \nTeams, members of the portfolio management boards \nand for portfolio company ESG teams.\nPillar I \u2013 Abris as a model ESG organization\nAbris \nlevel\nInvestment \nCommittee\nInvestment \nTeam\n\u2022\tInstills RI principles in investment procedures and portfolio companies\n\u2022\tAnalyzes ESG information in investment documentation\n\u2022\tProvides guidance on a wide range of ethical, governance, social and environmental \nchallenges\n\u2022\tExecutes on the ESG rules\n\u2022\tEnsures ESG due diligence\n\u2022\tIdentifies and manages ESG issues throughout the transaction process\n\u2022\tMonitors execution of ESG standards in the portfolio companies\nESG governance\nAbris \nlevel\nPortfolio \ncompany \nlevel\nESG  \nCoordinator\nESG Team\nESG Team\nESG \nAdministrators\nESG Director\n\u2022\tSets ESG goals and action plan\n\u2022\tOversees the implementation of ESG goals and projects\n\u2022\tCoordinates ESG activities\n\u2022\tReports internally\n\u2022\tOngoing management of ESG areas\n\u2022\tExecuting on ESG goals\n\u2022\tRaising management standards in ESG \n\u2022\tReports ESG incidents to the ESG Coordinator\n\u2022\tMonitor progress of ESG action plans\n\u2022\tDevelop Abris ESG standards\n\u2022\tImplements and develops the ESG process, i.e., Fund investment and \nportfolio monitoring\n\u2022\tDevelops ESG best practices\n\u2022\tCooperates closely with Investment Teams to review ESG progress\n\u2022\tPromotes the Abris ESG approach and methodology via industry \nconferences and ESG articles, brochures, etc.\n\u2022\tManges ESG external reporting, especially to the LPs\n\u2022\tSupervises ESG Coordinators\nESG Team\nDedicated \nPartner\n\u2022\tDirectly responsible for ESG integration \n\u2022\tCoordinates the Abris ESG efforts\n\u2022\tLeads ESG communication with the Abris Limited Partners\n Abris Capital Partners\n27\n26\nThe investment process\nSelection of targets \u2013 in-depth due diligence \u2013 contri-\nbution to the decision making process\nWe integrate ESG components into decision making \nmilestones at every stage of the investment process. \nFrom investment target identification, to investment \napproval, to exit, we set clear goals for the Deal Teams \nand deliver a precise value track record to the Abris \nInvestment Committee and Partnership Board.\nPortfolio monitoring \nTailor made planning \u2013 Regular review \u2013 measure-\nment of created value \u2013 Transparent reporting\nOur Investment and ESG Teams closely cooperate \nwith the portfolio companies. Once the transaction is \nclosed, the ESG Team performs an in-depth, post-ac-\nquisition analysis. Based on the results, both a long-\nterm and annual ESG Action Plans are formulated. \nThe ESG Action Plans are then agreed upon with the \nInvestment Team. Status of implementation of selected \nprojects within Abris\u2019 portfolio companies is tracked \nand measured by the ESG Scoring application.\nWe want to make it easy for our companies to join \nus in this effort. The ESG Team meets with company \nmanagement to present our approach and the ESG \nmanual is passed on to the Management Board. The \nportfolio company ESG team, supervised by the CEO, is \ncomprised of an ESG Coordinator and several internally \nrecruited members relevant to the business profile. \nProgress is evaluated during quarterly ESG calls, when \nthe current situation and any ESG incidents are dis-\ncussed. This information is presented to the Supervisory \nBoard in quarterly reports.\nIn 2020, the ESG Team conducted \n117 interviews during the annual ESG \nportfolio companies review. A total \nof 39 quarterly ESG calls took place \nbetween the team and portfolio \ncompanies.\nAt the beginning of each year, the ESG Team visits all \nportfolio companies. A comprehensive ESG analysis, \nsummary of the previous year and the ESG Action Plan \nfor the coming year are finalized. \nESG areas important for all Abris portfolio companies \nare:\n\u2022\tCorporate governance best practice & business \ncontinuity plan\n\u2022\tRemuneration and motivation\n\u2022\tAnti-corruption and whistleblowing\n\u2022\tAdaptation to climate change and managing \ncarbon footprint\n\u2022\tProducts and services security\n\u2022\tHuman rights and H&S standards\n\u2022\tCybersecurity\nThe ESG Team prepares materials, trainings, solutions \nand templates to help better manage these areas.\nThe Abris ESG Scoring Tool, from ESG to Value \nEnhancement\nWe have developed the Abris ESG Scoring Application, \nan innovative IT tool that supports investment decision \nmaking and ESG portfolio oversight. The key objectives \nare risk management and value creation through \nplanning, monitoring, and measuring our ESG impact. \nWe have recently added a carbon footprint and \nclimate change module, expanding the application\u2019s \nutility as a unique and forward-looking solution. \nWe are also working on two new portfolio value crea-\ntion modules:\n\u2022\tAn Internal Control Framework\n\u2022\tTechnology, cybersecurity and IT\nThe new Internal Control Framework is a comprehen-\nsive guide to creating and monitoring internal controls \nsystem. By introducing an Internal Control Framework, \nwe are able to design, implement and assess the \neffectiveness of all portfolio internal controls.\nThe technology, cybersecurity and IT module in ESG \nScoring is only one part of our systematic approach to \nmonitoring execution progress. Protecting IT systems \nfrom disruption and cyberattacks is critical to our \nbusiness. The scope of Abris\u2019 approach is divided into \nthree categories: business continuity resilience against \nsystems failures, cybersecurity strategy and digitaliza-\ntion. \nPillar II \u2013 End-to-end processes\nExclusion List\nEvery potential portfolio company is checked against \nthe Abris Exclusion List , based on international stand-\nards and all contractual terms included in our LPAs. \nOur criteria are based on the overarching principles of \nrespecting human rights and protecting the environ-\nment. \nThis means we will not do business with companies \ninvolved in, for example: \n\u2022\tActivities that contravene UN or EU conventions \non fundamental rights such as child labor, racial \ndiscrimination, trade embargo, environmental \nprotection \n\u2022\tProduction or trade of alcohol\n\u2022\tProduction or trade of tobacco\n\u2022\tDrift net fishing using nets in excess of 2.5 km. in \nlength\n\u2022\tMaterial / systemic corruption \nESG categorization\nThe ESG Team is working on an internal tool for desig-\nnating new targets to a relevant risk category, facil-\nitating better scoping and management of ESG due \ndiligence processes. \nESG due diligence\nESG is a mandatory component of the due diligence \nprocess at Abris. The ESG due diligence procedure \npertains to each new and add-on investment. For new \ntarget companies, the Investment Teams work with \nESG colleagues to determine the scope of ESG due \ndiligence required. When the process is completed, \nESG advisors submit reports to the Investment and ESG \nTeams for discussion. Significant issues are revealed \nin a red flag report to the Investment Committee. If the \ndeal is nearing its closing stage, a final report is pro-\nvided and reviewed. A Deal Qualifying Memorandum \nwith an ESG action plan is then sent to the Investment \nCommittee. The ESG plan is further developed into a \npost-investment 100-day plan.\n2 The full criteria are available from the Exclusion List on the Abris website: \nhttps://abris-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Exclusion-list.pdf\nInitial stage\n\u2022\tExclusion List\nDue diligence\n\u2022\tESG categorization\n\u2022\tESG Due diligence \n\u2022\tRed Flag Report \nInvestment \ndecision\n\u2022\tDQM\n\u2022\tInvestment \nCommittee\n\u2022\t100-day plan\n\u2022\tESG action plans\nMonitoring & \nvalue creation\n\u2022\tPost-acquisition \nESG DD\n\u2022\tESG plan execution \n\u2022\tQuarterly calls \n\u2022\tAnnual monitoring \n& site visits \n02.

Learning from the pandemic experience \nhow to quickly develop risk management solutions, we \norganized workshops on the preparation and improve-\nment of Business Continuity Plans. Fifty participants \nof top portfolio company executives joined in our ESG \ntraining as a part of the ESG Academy.\nCEOs also had the opportunity to participate in a train-\ning on the business impact of climate change by the \nUnited Nations Global Compact Poland. We conducted \nworkshops on the analysis of climate change-related \nrisks and opportunities. As part of the ESG Academy, we \nalso initiated diversity & inclusion workshops. \nA responsible investor\u2019s credibility among its stake-\nholders is based on reliable ESG data and high-quality \ncommunication. Abris strives for a best-in-class report-\ning architecture to ensure the quality and value of \nour ESG impact and to allow for open communication \nwith our stakeholders. Engagement is how we impart \nour approach to sustainable business practices to the \nwider investment community. It is also how we present \nour views and expectations to portfolio companies. \nOur approach has been recognized by reputable inter-\nnational initiatives promoting responsible business. In \n2019, The Ethical Corporation shortlisted us for the Re-\nsponsible Investment Awards. We were recognized for \nour leadership in corporate responsibility, sustainability, \ntransparency, and investment stewardship. In 2020, \nour Agile & Comprehensive ESG Management System \nwas selected as the Emerging Markets Initiative of the \nYear by PRI.

Together we implemented the \nprojects to minimize and identify potential ESG risks \nand creating value.\nEnvironmental initiatives were a top priority at our \ncompanies in 2020. We utilize 107 separate measures \nfor analyzing key environmental indicators for our \nportfolio companies, such as: examining emissions, \nwaste, energy & water consumption, analyzing soil \npollution, monitoring climate change and environmen-\ntal requirements. Based on the results, each company \nreceives an action plan.\nWe manage risk and build value by using over 150 \nmeasures of social issues. Among those, we pay strict \nattention to Human Resources, Health & Safety, prod-\nuct/service safety. \nOur portfolio companies incorporate comprehensive \nHuman Resources processes, formalize topics such \nas working hours, overtime, salaries, holidays, the right \nto associate, outsourcing, labor law compliance, and \nmobbing/sexual abuse.\nIn 2020 our particular consideration was on imple-\nmentation of the Business Continuity Plan, 70% of our \nportfolio companies performed a comprehensive BCP. \n100% of companies participated in the training on how \nto prepare the Business Continuity Plan effectively.\nThe following examples illustrate the implemented ESG \nprojects in 2020:\nProject\n% of portfolio companies*\nArea\nCarbon footprint measurement in scope 1 and 2 \nEfficiency of water sources\nMeasuring the noise level at the production\nProcedures in place for managing waste\nAppointed a manager for environmental issues\nEnergy efficiency audits\nISO 14001 certification\nAnti-discrimination policy\nExperienced HR manager\nMachinery Safety audit\nISO 45001 certification\nSafe driving training \nH&S management system\nImplementation of actions to reduce the number of accidents\nAbris Corporate Governance Model\nBusiness Continuity Plan\nAnti-bribery policy \nESG Sponsor at Board level\n100%\n60%\n100%\n60%\n100%\n40%\n70%\n60%\n100%\n30%\n30%\n100%\n30%\n60%\n100%\n70%\n90%\n60%\nEnvironment\nSocial\nGovernance\n* average of portfolio companies obligated to implement the project\n Abris Capital Partners\n41\n40\n1. What would help accelerate the Abris portfolio\u2019s \ngreen transition, and how can the associated risks be \neffectively managed?\nThe transition toward carbon neutrality by 2025 is a \nvery ambitious target for Abris Capital Partners. It will \nrequire big investments and financing to maximize \nthe shift to renewable energy to effectively reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Thus, access to financing \nfor green projects is essential to a smooth transition. \nAlthough the EU promised such financing to help \ncompanies toward the transition through the Green \nDeal funds, the long timeframe of the European \nlegislation process and its implementation in Member \nStates is a risk that cannot be ignored. Therefore, Abris \nshould look to fund its energy efficiency and renewable \nprojects through private modes of financing. Moreo-\nver, countries where Abris portfolio of companies are \nlocated can oppose or delay the transition, even in an \nindirect form, by doing too little in that direction. This \nis a risk that Abris should take into consideration: they \ncannot rely on state policy measures but must pursue \na pro-active approach.\n2. Where is the value in the Gold Standard best \npractice standard and how do you see the current role \nof Green Group in the climate transition process in \nEurope?\nGold Standard is known throughout the world as one \nof the best promoter NGOs for the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals through its certified green projects. \nGreen Group\u2019s plastic recycling project has been \ncertified by Gold Standard for its CO2 emissions savings \nand has obtained carbon credits that are needed by \ncompanies to offset their carbon footprint. This is a \npilot project in Europe that can be a model for other \nprojects to enhance the transition toward a circular \nand net zero emissions economy in the EU.\n3. How would you convince company CEOs that \nclimate change policies and GHG emissions reduction \ncreates value from a business standpoint?\nI believe it is quite difficult to convince companies \nand CEOs of the value of climate neutrality, at least in \nthe short-term, because they will always look at their \nyearly profit margin. In the medium- and long-run, \nGHG emissions reduction will save energy, gas, and \nother related costs. Moving toward ESG principles will \nboost profitability and increase investors\u2019 confidence in \nthe business. If CEOs base their decisions on a 10-year \nbudgetary framework, they cannot afford to lose the \nthread of this transition. \n1. How is business in Central Europe currently respond-\ning to climate change? How does the Abris carbon \nneutrality strategy fit into that context?\nUntil now, Central Europe has lacked leaders in manag-\ning its climate impact. But today we have a common \ninternational goal of climate neutrality by 2050, which \nis reflected in emerging legal regulations, sustainable \nfinancing, and changes in consumer behavior. Busi-\nness in Central Europe must reprogram its thinking, \nmeasure its carbon footprint, and define a strategy \nfor achieving climate neutrality. There is a lot of work \nahead for business, but today there is a lot of activity \nin this area. Abris\u2019 strategy of climate neutrality meets \ncontemporary challenges very well.\n2. Which climate change transition opportunities and \ntrends should Abris be considering when planning \nfuture investments?\nThe first things that come to mind are areas related \nto renewable energy sources and improved energy \nefficiency. In many industries, R&D encompasses ac-\ntivities that promote the mitigation of and adaptation \nto climate change, alongside product manufacturing \nand services that also contribute to climate change \nmitigation and adaptation for customers. These \nactivities align with a very strong trend of reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and building resilience to \nclimate change.\n3. Will customers and consumers be putting pressure \non suppliers in Central Europe if they disagree with \nregional and business climate policies, regulations \nand commitments?\nClients and consumers are already demanding carbon \nfootprint and/or environmental footprint disclosure, cli-\nmate change policies and strategies, climate neutrality \nstrategies, etc., from suppliers, as a basis for starting or \ncontinuing a collaboration or joint action regarding a \npolicy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It should \nbe noted that these requirements are presented \nmainly by companies from mature markets in Western \nEurope and Scandinavia, but also other regions of the \nworld. Emerging regulatory requirements, e.g., related \nto public reporting about managing the impact of \ncompanies on the climate or reporting to banks or \ninvestors in this regard will serve to spread these \npractices.\nCasiana \nFometescu\nInternational CO2 Consultant \nFounder of Carbon Expert \nwww.carbonexpert.ro \nMicha\u0142 \nStalmach \nSenior Sustainability Consultant \nat Bureau Veritas Polska\nESG Report 2020  |  Abris as a responsible and active owner\nThe actions we take are based on reliable knowledge, \nproven data and effective solutions.

From 2020, our products have been \navailable in 55 countries on six continents.\nCompanies and economies are more interdependent than ever, supply \nchains are more complex and interconnected, social and environmental \ntensions are more distinct than in the past and regulation is accelerating \nto address increasing imbalances between corporate growth and social \nneeds. \nKeeping our workforce safe is and always will be our top priority. We \nbelieve a safe company is a well-run company.\nDue to both the spread of Covid-19 and commodity price volatility, we are \nactively taking steps to mitigate business risk while continuing to ensure \nsafe, sustainable and reliable operations across our assets.

Therefore, the construction of new, highly \nflammable grain and oilseed storage silos has required \nus to upgrade our fire protections to the highest \npossible level.\nWe completed the drilling of our own well and the \nconstruction of a 100 m3 reservoir to provide a secure \nsupply of water to the fire hydrant network. This way \nour water supply became completely independent \nof the unstable city water supply system. Today, fire \nextinguishers have the necessary water pressure to \nreach a fire at extensive heights. Powerful aggregates \nhave been installed that provide the hydrants with \nwater under high pressure, even in the event of a \npower failure. \nResults\nIn terms of internal fire protection, we have covered \nall control rooms in the feed factory and in the premix \nfactory with fireproof panels, a reliable fire barrier. \nIn 2020, the premix and feed additive factories were \nequipped with a modern fire alarm system, as well as a \ngas leak detection system.\nWe also addressed fire prevention. All employees \nreceived additional training in fire protection. We con-\nducted a fire simulation in order to check employee \nresponses in emergency situations.\nSignificant funds were invested in improving fire \nprevention and firefighting systems as one part of our \nongoing efforts to achieve sustainable development \nand stable growth.\nTo facilitate entry into new markets \nand ensure legal compliance, we \nhave implemented a background \ncheck procedure for our potential \nbusiness partners. When we receive \ninformation about a potential client \nfrom the International Department, \nwe obtain the information from the \nnational authorities in order to get \na complete and accurate picture \nof the company. Following that, we \nreview the databases of the Minis-\ntry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic \nof Serbia, the European Commis-\nsion and the Security Council of \nthe United Nations to determine \nwhether any states, persons or \nentities are under sanctions.\nIn 2020, we purchased equipment \nthat provides excellent High Per-\nformance Liquid Chromatography \n(HPLC) daily analyses of vitamins in \nvitamin-mineral premixes. We have \nimplemented a new Quality Policy \nregarding quality and safety of \nanimal feed and premixtures and a \nnew Complaints Policy. \nWe are also among the first in \nthe world who have successfully \nimplemented the new FAMI-QS \nFeed Fraud Prevention and Defense \nModule, demonstrating our ability \nto effectively manage and mitigate \nthe risk of feed fraud and terrorism.\nOur main aimed is to ensure that \nour products are beneficial and safe \nfor animals, cost-effective for our \ncustomers and sustainable for the \nenvironment. We enthusiastically \nendorsed our owner\u2019s decision to \nemphasize ecology in 2020. The first \nstep was calculating our carbon \nfootprint. During the process, we \ndiscovered that there was room for \nimprovement in the manufacturing \nprocess and supply chain. We up-\ngraded the packing process, where \napplying a thin layer of biodegrad-\nable glue onto the bags enabled \nthe stability of the bags on the \npallet. We substantially increased \nthe sale of bulk animal feed and, \ntherefore, significantly reduced the \namount of packaging used.\n161k tonnes\nproduced and sold in 2020\n32%\nlowered production costs \nper kg from 2016 to 2020\n55 \ncountries on six \ncontinents\n 54\nFund II\nESG Report 2020  |  Portfolio overview\n55\nAbris Capital Partners\nEnvironment\nSocial\nGovernance\nKey project:\nOperation projects masterplan \nand weekly management review\nPehart is the biggest tissue paper producer in Romania and the largest \nindependent player in Southeast Europe with an annual turnover of more \nthan \u20ac100 million.\nPehart operates in two modern sites, one with a long history in producing \nnumerous types of paper products, opened 1837 and another one opened \nin 2015. Both are located in the country center, Transylvania. The company \nhas increased the tissue production capacity by 33% since Abris\u2019 entry \nwhile the converting capacity amplified 3 times.\nWe believe that technology and innovation are key to that growth. But we \nbelieve most strongly in people. They are the reason that we embrace \nsustainable ESG practices in our daily work; to create a more sustainable \nworld for our employees and our stakeholders. For example, transparent \ncommunication is at the core of our business. When it comes to con-\nsumers, we aim to communicate in a responsible, flexible, honest and \nconstructive way. This brings its own rewards in the form of increasing \nemployee and customer loyalty and pride in our work.\nGabriel Stanciu \nCEO Pehart\nOur mission is to grow our business by  \noffering products of the highest standards  \non the market at a price-to-quality ratio  \nthat is fair to consumers.\nPehart\nPehart developed an annual projects masterplan in \n2020, directed toward investment and cost-saving \nmeasures. Projects are first approved in the budget \nsubmitted to the Supervisory Board. A project leader is \nassigned and a time frame is allocated to each project, \nincluding a date for the first management review. The \nmanagement team will assess the status of the select-\ned projects on a weekly basis, then decide if and when a \nnew review should take place. Only when all results are \ndemonstrated to be sustainable is the project complete. \nResults\nThe masterplan helps to improve business results and \nallow management to exert more visibility and control \nover company resources. By measuring a project\u2019s de-\nvelopment and results, we can affirm the importance \nof both high-quality execution and meeting business \nexpectations. We also make sure that decisions re-\ngarding the allocation of the necessary resources are \ntaken early enough to ensure the best results. During \n2020, we recieved \u20ac750,000 in savings from projects \nimplemented under our new masterplan umbrella. \nIn addition, the masterplan drives organizational de-\nvelopment. Young professionals are trained in project \nmanagement principles and tools, entitled to project \nownership, encouraged to ask questions and access \ncompany resources. They will all receive management \nassessments.\nSince the masterplan was initiated, project manage-\nment knowledge and skills have spread throughout \nthe organization. The establishment of project tracking \ndiscipline and the empowerment of those colleagues \nbeneath the level of top management have made \nsignificant contributions to our company culture.\nWe implemented a self-service \nsystem for the spare parts ware-\nhouse. Anyone taking spare parts \nfrom the warehouse first scans \ntheir access card before the parts \ncan be taken. In this way, logs are \nautomatically updated in real-time \nwithout any printed and manually \nsigned documents.

While the Velvet CARE brand was established \nin 2013, the entire history of the company reaches back to the founding in \n1897. Velvet CARE operates in the following key tissue product categories: \ntoilet paper (dry and moist), kitchen towels, facial tissues and handker-\nchiefs. In 2020, Velvet CARE acquired the Czech company Moracell, also \ncovering similar market segments. \nThe company possesses 2 tissue machines, 14 converting lines in Poland \n(Klucze plant) and 2 converting lines in Czech (\u017dab\u010dice plant). The firm\u2019s \nmanufacturing output has tripled since its establishment (2013-2021).\nVelvet CARE is also an important supplier of Private Label products for \nthe whole CEE and DACH region and enters the AwayFromHome / Horeca \nsegment.\nWe grow dynamically and we aim to reduce our impact on the natural \nenvironment and carbon footprint. While steadily investing in continued \ndevelopment at our two plants in Klucze (Poland) and \u017dab\u010dice (Czech), \nwe follow Eco Agenda 2025 motto \u201cAchieve more with less.\u201d We continue \nworking in accordance with ethical standards, support our employees and \nthe local community. It was especially true in 2020, when we responded \nwith a high commitment to the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nOur reputation is built on doing reliable business and facilitating respon-\nsible and transparent cooperation with our partners. To emphasize the \nimportance of our ESG strategy and ensure its implementation, in 2020 \nthe management board decided to establish the new senior position of \nESG Leader. All these initiatives are designed to strengthen the company \nfoundation of the highest business standards, a sound ESG strategy and a \ncompetitive, ambitious organization.\nArtur Pielak \nCEO Velvet CARE\nIntroducing ESG standards at Velvet CARE \nis one of our key strategic initiatives to \nensure both sustainable development \nand\u00a0a\u00a0competitive advantage on the market. \nVelvet CARE \nIn 2019, we initiated our new sustainable development \nstrategy, Eco Agenda 2025. This provides a road map for \nthe ambitions and goals we set for the coming years. The \nagenda\u2019s motto \u201cAchieve more with less\u201d means that we \nalways strive to do more. Continual development is one of \nour core values. However, we wish to progress responsibly, \nwith respect for the environment upon which we all depend. \nEco Agenda 2025 focuses on three strategic pillars: Product, \nOrganisation & Infrastructure and Inspiration & Education. \n2020 was our first year for implementing the strategy \ninto real, tangible action. We undertook several new \ninitiatives, including environmental friendly changes to \na number of our products.\nResults\nWe introduced technological changes aimed at \necological benefits for our products. These changes \ndeliver environmental advantages in the areas of \nrecyclability, decreased plastic usage and a reduced \ncarbon footprint. \nFirstly, in the tissues category we re-designed the \ndimensions of Velvet facial tissue boxes to enable \nefficient storage and transport. This change also \nresulted in reducing our carbon footprint. Secondly, \nwe removed the foil insert from the opening in our \nfacial tissue boxes, thereby contributing to our plas-\ntic reduction initiative and helping consumers with \neasy waste segregation. Thirdly, we changed the box \nvarnish to a water soluble, ecological type. Finally, the \nnew cardboard used in Velvet tissues is FSC\u00ae certified, \nconfirming our care for forests and natural resources. \nIn the product categories that are foil packed, we \ndecided to reduce the material grammar, resulting in \na further reduction in plastic used. The total result is a \n5,9% reduction in our plastic usage in 2020 vs 2019. \nTo strengthen our principles of \nhonesty and ethics, the Procedure \nfor Identifying Potential Fraud has \nbeen implemented. It serves as a \nsupporting element for the trans-\nparency of our organization and \nas an essential tool for avoiding all \nforms of corruption. \nIn 2020, we established the imple-\nmentation of compliance clauses \nin our business contracts to ensure \nrespect for human rights and \nanti-bribery standards.\nDespite the challenges of Cov-\nid-19, development activities and \ntrainings were carried out as \nusual. However, it was important to \nlaunch new communication chan-\nnels (on-line) and provide tools to \nensure the health and safety of our \nemployees. \nAdditionally, an employee satis-\nfaction survey was conducted to \ncollect feedback that allows us to \nunderstand, revise and redefine our \nplans of continuous development. \nSustainable menagement of water \nresources in Velvet CARE is one of \nthe key elements of the company\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy. Owing to \nstate-of-the-art technologies used \nin our facility, consumption of fresh \nwater is limited and efficiency of its \ntreatment is continually enhanced.\nWe are constantly working to make \nthe consumption of energy that we \nneed, as low as possible. Actions \nthat were taken in 2020 include in-\nstallation of a water turbine by the \nTM7 paper machine and replace-\nment of lights for energy-saving \nLEDs in a part of the Klucze plant.\n124 yrs \npaper factory\n\u20ac 175M\nconsolidated turnover\n850 \nemployees \n(Velvet CARE & Moracell)\n 68\nESG Report 2020  |  Portfolio overview\n69\nAbris Capital Partners\nEnvironment\nSocial\nGovernance\n68\n69\nESG Report 2020  |  Portfolio overview\nFund III\nKey project:\nNew European Service Center and \nimplementation of the new ERP system \nWDX S.A. has over 25 years of experience in providing integrated intralo-\ngistics solutions.

The European Service Center was opened in 2020 and \nallows for centralized preparation of new and used forklifts for operation \nand, consequently, for the dynamic development of short-term rental. The \ncompany employs 360 people in six branches in Poland and is expanding \nits dealer network in Europe. WDX opened its branch office in Germany in \n2020.\nToday, our long-term strategy emphasizes two main areas:\n- Further improving corporate governance, business ethics and working \nconditions, as well as opportunities for our employees, our most valuable \nasset, to develop their skills \n- Environmental protection through the introduction of standards and \nmodern technologies that allow us to reduce pollutant emissions and de-\ncrease generated waste and to provide proper recycling methodologies.\nDariusz B\u0105kowski \nCEO WDX S.A. \nFor many years now, when developing our \nstrategies we focus on maximizing company \nprofits and shareholder value. But we do also focus \non environmental protection, social\u00a0issues and \nrelations with other stakeholder groups. \nWDX\nOne of our most important investments of 2020 was \nthe construction of the European Forklift Service \nCenter. The facility was built in Zgierz and has an area \nof 5,000\u00a0m2. The investment significantly raised work \nefficiency and services all forklift models that WDX \nhas in its portfolio. Through the introduction of quality \ncontrols and modern technologies, this new Service \nCenter meets the highest standards of environmental \nand safety regulations. \nIn 2020, WDX introduced the most modern forklifts on \nthe Polish market, meeting the highest standards of \nenergy efficiency and safety. Together with Crown, we \nare selling forklifts in Poland utilizing the GenaTM intel-\nligent operating system with a Polish language inter-\nface. GenaTM gives a forklift operator security reminders \nand dynamic real-time coaching messages that \nincrease safety during forklift operation. With Doosan \nwe have introduced a new S7 series of diesel forklifts \nthat meet the highest EURO5 standard, that leads to a \nreduction of exhaust emissions and noise.\nIn 2020, WDX was focused on implementation of a new \nERP system that not only enables better organization of \nprocesses and analysis of financial data, but also will \nallow WDX to better measure and understand non-fi-\nnancial factors during our analysis to identify material \nrisks. ERP implementation also triggered a process of \nreview of company policies. Process descriptions were \nupdated. Policy for Annual Stock Count, Fleet Policy and \nTravelling Policy were prepared and signed, others are \nbeing prepared or updated. \nAt WDX S.A., emphasis is placed on \ncompliance with the law when we \ndo business. To remind employees \nof existing regulations, we under-\ntook training activities in 2020. Also, \nan information campaign was \nlaunched that included presenting \ncompliance topics in an accessible \nway using posters placed in each \nbranch of WDX S.A. In addition, \ncompliance with the company\u2019s \nAnti-Corruption Policy was consist-\nently monitored.\nIn the summer of 2020, we installed \nan overhead crane with a lifting \ncapacity of 8 tonnes in the 18-me-\nter wide nave. This investment \nimproved assembly work and \nhas reduced the need for diesel \nforklifts in the crowded production \narea. This has increased the safety \nand comfort of our production \nemployees. The crane is invaluable, \nespecially when production teams \nmust lift elements that require \nbeing precisely connected.\nIn 2020, we replaced a twenty-\nyear-old powder paint shop with a \nnew, modern paint shop benefiting \nfrom improved technical param-\neters and reduced impact on \nenvironment. The powder used for \npainting is filtered in a closed cycle \n(without atmospheric emissions), \nallowing us to save thermal energy \nin winter. As a result, painting effi-\nciency has increased by providing \nsignificant savings in heat (gas) \nand water consumption.\n19,570\nforklift service orders \ncompleted annually\n20\nExport Sales to 20 \ncountries \n6k tonnes\nof steel per year \u2013 our \nproduction capabilities \n Abris Capital Partners\n71\n70\nESG Report 2020\nThe information contained in the report refers to 2020 unless otherwise stated.\nContact: Robert Sroka, ESG Director for CE, e-mail: r.sroka@abris-capital.com\nMonika Nachyla\nPartner\nOlga Jab\u0142o\u0144ska\nESG Coordinator \u2013 Poland\nRobert Sroka\nESG Director\nOana Mihai\nESG Coordinator \u2013 Romania\nAbris Capital Partners continues to participate in the United Nations Global Compact Initiative, focusing on the UNGC\u2019s \nten principles for Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption.

This is exemplified by the Covid-19 \npandemic. Here at Abris, we have safely navigated through this time with a \nsense of responsibility and purpose from our teams. By teams, I mean the \nAbris, portfolio and investors\u2019 teams, but most importantly our families, who \nstood behind us with encouragement and a much-needed supporting smile.  \nI want to thank them for their strength, contributions and their kindness. \n2019 was a very busy year for our Abris ESG practice as we continued to incor-\nporate ESG principles into our investment activities.\nIn line with our commitments to sustainability, ethical stewardship and ESG dis-\nclosure, corporate governance was our 2019 ESG priority. We devoted the time \nand effort required to rethink our approach, study legislative changes, and \nreview our collective experiences. As a result, our new Corporate Governance \nCommittee developed a comprehensive model based on two central princi-\nples - building investment value and mitigating risks. The Corporate Govern-\nance Model has not only broadened our transparency, control, and distribution \nof competencies among the three corporate lines of defense, it has stream-\nlined the pivotal coordination between management and supervisory roles at \nall our portfolio companies.\nI am proud of the deep creative thinking process we have undergone in that \nproject. The first step in \u201ccreative thinking\u201d is always \u201cthinking.\u201d Yet, no single \nidea is flawless. Like a rough diamond, all new ideas have some defects. They \nmust be scrutinized and refined to fulfill their true promise. Therefore, we \nunderstand that unlearning, relearning, and unceasing questioning are key to \nthat process. In fact, these are some of our core strengths at Abris. They help \nus to continue evolving into a better, more resilient organization. \nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nAbris has navigated the CE region  \nwith the eyes on the horizon and the world  \nin mind for the last decade.  \nWe know these waters by heart \u2014\nand we responsibly steer companies towards \nremarkable growth and great value.\nThe Value Enhancement Team established last year, represents that philoso-\nphy and our mission. Their role is to bring ESG standards, internal controls, and \nrisk management into our daily portfolio management standards and proce-\ndures to augment our impact. I am convinced that they can forge our experi-\nence and hard-won lessons into an invaluable asset for all our stakeholders.\nAbris has selected carbon footprint management as the new theme for our \nESG 2020 Universe program. As a responsible investor, we intend to invest \nheavily in developing an emission-neutral portfolio. Despite the challenges, \nwe are determined to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with a \nclear 2020 focus on SDG 13 - Climate Action. I know that pursuing such ambi-\ntious targets can be a never-ending journey and it will not happen overnight, \nbut I believe that whenever opportunity shows itself \u2013 we are there.\nI hope readers will gain an appreciation for the 2019 edition of our ESG report \nand the work we do to promote responsible business and community sus-\ntainability. To everyone at Abris, our partners and friends, please stay safe and \nhealthy.\nSincerely,\nPawel Gierynski\nManaging Partner\n ESG Report 2019  |  Abris as a responsible investor\n11\nAbris Capital Partners\n10\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has \nimposed an unprecedented \nglobal crisis, materially affect-\ning both Abris\u2019 activities and \nmodus operandi. The scale \nand depth of the impact on \nbusiness and everyday life \nexceeded all scenario planning \nincluded in the most visionary \nrisk management systems. \nThis situation should be con-\nsidered as a competence and \nresponsibility test, both for Abris \nor our portfolio teams. Even \nthough the test differed greatly \ndepending upon the business \nspecifics, the challenge was \nsignificant for all. \nAbris\nOur immediate reaction to the crisis \nwas reorganizing the firm\u2019s operating \nmodel to protect the team and se-\ncure continuous business processes. \nTherefore, all team members moved \nto remote working and meetings \nmigrated to online video conferenc-\ning platforms such as Zoom and MS \nTeams. We extended our business \ncontinuity plan with an internal \npolicy on the Coronavirus disease, \nintroducing strict rules on hygienic \nstandards, travel, interactions and \ncommunications. The new approach \nincluded regular internal coordi-\nnation meetings for the leadership \ngroup, weekly situation reporting, \ndaily interactions with the portfolio \nmanagement and constant monitor-\ning of governmental responses in CE \ncountries. Some team members as-\nsumed specific, new responsibilities, \nactively contributing to the building \nof a common knowledge database. \nAll deal teams shared their portfolio \nbest practices to accommodate any \nchanging legislative or administra-\ntive measures, as well as optimizing \nbusiness solutions. \nOpen and proactive investor com-\nmunications are key to Abris IR ac-\ntivity, therefore, a biweekly Covid-19 \nNewsletter was introduced imme-\ndiately. This included portfolio risk \nassessment, categorizing all com-\npanies into four groups: risk, concern, \npotential concern & no concern, \nwhile delivering clear data on risk \nevolution. Team status, the econom-\nic measures undertaken by each \ngovernment and valuation variations \nwere described whenever available \nand relevant, receiving a positive \nreception from all limited partners.\nIn parallel, all internal business pro-\ncesses were run in an uninterrupted \nmanner, including the Investment \nCommittee and Partners\u2019 meetings, \nregular monthly reporting, invest-\nment, and ESG activities. \nPortfolio\nFollowing the Abris ESG Corporate \nGovernance Model and well before \nthe pandemic emerged, all portfo-\nlio companies were requested to \nprepare and implement a Business \nContinuity Plan. The key focus of such \nplans was to secure the relevant level \nof crisis management, sufficient li-\nquidity and supply chain contingency \nplanning. Therefore, when confronted \nwith the new reality, all crisis manage-\nment teams were formed overnight, \nassuming decision making responsi-\nbility and ready to react quickly. \nOur priority was to secure human \nresources availability. All necessary \nmeasures were defined to protect all \nemployee groups, especially those \non the production lines. Special care \nhas been taken for the most vul-\nnerable employees, assuring social \ndistancing and medical help. All \nmanagement teams reviewed and \nidentified liquidity risks, established \nemergency action plans and se-\ncured an extension of bank facilities \nwhen necessary. Since international \nlogistics remained a significant chal-\nlenge for all production companies, \nincreased raw materials stocks were \nguaranteed and alternative suppliers \nidentified. \nDespite the challenging business \ncircumstances, most portfolio teams \ndemonstrated their responsible \nsocial commitment by launching \nnumerous projects supporting both \nlocal communities and healthcare \ninfrastructure. Those initiatives \nconsisted of direct financial aid, as \nwell as providing hygiene products \nand medical devices, confirming the \nteams\u2019 solidarity and responsibilities.\nPost Covid-19\nThe Abris team regards this current \ncrisis as an opportunity to stress-\ntest all portfolio business models, \nproactively looking for new oppor-\ntunities to modify and strengthen \nour investments. Learning from each \nexperience is an essential element of \nthe firm\u2019s philosophy and approach \nto business. Therefore, a compre-\nhensive review process has been \nconducted and transformed into \nstrategy enhancements for several \nportfolio companies. \nAbris and Abris portfolio  \ncompanies in coronavirus  \npandemic period update\n\u201cThe illiterate of the 21st \ncentury will not be those \nwho cannot read and write, \nbut those who cannot \nlearn, unlearn, and relearn.\u201d\n \nAlvin Toffler\n ESG Report 2019  |  About us\n13\nAbris Capital Partners\n12\nAbris Capital Partners is an in-\ndependent private equity fund \nmanager focused on mid-mar-\nket buyout and growth oppor-\ntunities in the major countries \nof Central Europe.

The company\u2019s unique \noffering is complemented by propri-\netary software platforms. \nPrior to investing, our ESG due dil-\nigence was focused on the legal \ncompliance, risk and best practices \nperspectives in the following areas: \nHuman Resources, Cybersecurity \n& Data Management, Anti-Bribery, \nCompliance, Environment, Health \n& Safety and the Supply Chain. An \nexperienced advisory firm was ap-\npointed to complete the process.\nDue to the complex nature of com-\npany operations and specialized \nknowledge required, a team of six \nexperts was appointed. The team \nwas assisted by our ESG Team during \ntheir site visits. A full 70-hour audit \nwas carried out. Up to 30 hours alone \nwas dedicated to data manage-\nment, identified as the most relevant \nof ESG risks. \nOur ESG Team members partici-\npated in revision of documents and \nevidence, site visits and interviews \nwith employees responsible for \nESG. The due diligence results were \npresented in a red flag report and \nthe conclusions included in a DQM \nfrom the Investment Team to the \nInvestment Committee.

It is vital that \nwe understand and mitigate these \nrisks and opportunities in the short to \nlong term. In 2019, following TCFD and \nPRI, we upgraded our ESG Scoring \nTool to advance the management \nof emerging risks and opportunities. \nMoreover, Abris implemented the \nfollowing:\n\u2022\tTraining and workshops\n\u2022\tTools for measuring carbon foot-\nprint and analyzing the climate \nchange risk \n\u2022\tPilot project to measure and set \nreduction goals in carbon footprint \nThese measures will be extended to \nall portfolio companies from 2020. \nWe have also developed the first \nphase of a carbon footprint tool for \nevaluating our entire portfolio of \ncompanies.

It was also influenced \nby our employees, who suggested \ninstalling dispensers due to their \nconcern for the environment. The \ndecision was based on the following \ncriteria: creating a positive environ-\nmental impact by eliminating plastic \nwaste and reducing costs through a \nfixed monthly fee.\nOne of the measures of suc-\ncessful staff recruitment is a \nrapid response to incoming CVs and \napplications. This allows us to quickly \nselect candidates and schedule \ninterviews in advance of the compe-\ntition. Therefore, we chose to use ATS \nsoftware in order to save time when \nmanaging recruitment and hiring. \nE-Recruiter enables total automation \nof our recruitment process and is \nGDPR compliant.

Our initial effort was the \ninstallation of a new paper ma-\nchine with a gas boiler located to \nreduce the amount of gas needed to \nproduce steam. In 2018, we installed \nanother gas boiler room for an older \ntissue machine. We worked hard to \nincrease production efficiency by \nreducing electricity consumption per \nton of tissue paper. These measures \nsucceeded in reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions by 70% over a 5-year \nperiod.

The transaction is subject to Lithuanian antimonopoly clearance.</p> <p>Founded in 2014 and based in Vilnius, Kaunas and Klaip\u0117da, Visas transportas UAB handles around 20,000 orders per month. The company has two products: the Siusk24 parcel platform, serving primarily small and medium B2X clients; and the Cargobooking platform, which handles larger cargoes and freight. The acquisition has a strong strategic rationale, supporting Alsendo\u2019s international expansion and giving the business an immediate footprint in the Baltic parcel services market.</p> <p>The transaction follows Alsendo\u2019s earlier add-ons of: Sendit, a parcel services platform in Poland (July 2021); Zaslat, a technology-enabled parcel services platform focused on consumers and corporate clients in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (September 2022); Innoship, a Romanian SaaS carrier management software provider (October 2022); and Ecolet, a B2X focused parcel services platform in Romania (April 2023).</p> <p>Edgar Kolesnik, partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis is another step in Alsendo\u2019s journey to build the largest tech-enabled delivery management solutions provider in Central Europe. We are committed to achieving further international growth and driving investment in value creation, and the acquisition of Siusk24 and Cargobooking supports these goals. We remain focused on our ambitious buy-and-build strategy, and sustainable development of the organization through technological enhancement, international expansion and team integration.\u201d</em></p> <p>The acquisition of Visas transportas UAB will support Alsendo&#8217;s cross-border operations as an e-commerce enabler through access to new customer groups, known-how and technology, at the same time as allowing the business to deliver potential synergies. In addition, it supports Alsendo\u2019s position as a logistics technology sector consolidator across Central Europe, bringing in new geographies and unlocking cross-selling potential across the wider group.</p> <p>Abris originally acquired Alsendo (then called apaczka) in November 2020, with a plan to capitalize on the ongoing growth of e-commerce globally, at the same time executing an ambitious organic and acquisitive expansion program. Alsendo is now the largest delivery management solutions provider in Central Europe, operating as an end-to-end multi-carrier shipment intermediary dedicated to e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, global enterprises and SMEs, cooperating with the leading players in the regional courier delivery market.</p> <p>Magda Magnuszewska, CEO of Alsendo, added:<br /> <em>\u201cWe are happy to welcome the Siusk24 and Cargobooking teams and business to the Alsendo family. This is the most recent stage of our consolidation of the logistics sector in Central Europe. We have built a wealth of experience integrating businesses into the Alsendo platform and we continue to pursue our strategy of transitioning to a technology-driven, sustainable business model and expanding internationally.\u201d</em></p> <p>Egidijus Breik\u0161tas, CEO and Co-Founder of Visas transportas UAB, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis is an exciting development for Siusk24 and Cargobooking, bringing us into a wider group, which will allow us to unlock new growth opportunities and support Alsendo as it seeks to drive international expansion in the cross-border segment.

The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly and other regulatory approvals.</p> <p>The agreement sees Abris sign a partnership with Captain Fresh, India\u2019s leading tech-led seafood supply chain company backed by major investors, including Tiger Global Management, Prosus Ventures, British International Investment, Z47 (fka Matrix Partners India), Accel, SBI Holdings, Evolvence Group, Ankur Capital and Incubate Fund. Koral will become a key platform for the international market development of salmon products within the Captain Fresh group, in which Abris will take a stake.</p> <p>Based in Kukinia in Poland, Koral manufactures smoked salmon products that are sold across Poland and internationally. The company has 26 production lines, processing 120 tons of fish daily. The partnership with Captain Fresh follows Abris\u2019 separate exit of the Graal business to German food business M\u00fcller Group, which was agreed in February 2023.</p> <p>Kamil Gajdzi\u0144ski, Investment Manager at Abris, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis partnership between Koral and Captain Fresh is further evidence of the fantastic potential of Central European businesses and the growing appetite of international conglomerates for investment opportunities in the region. This has been a successful collaboration for Abris, Bogus\u0142aw Kowalski, Graal and Koral, and we are pleased that we have found the ideal partner in Captain Fresh, which will drive international growth and further consolidation in this sector.&#8221;</em></p> <p>The transaction with Captain Fresh follows a seven-year investment period, during which Koral has grown revenues and Ebitda consistently, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical challenges. Abris acquired a majority stake in Graal and Koral in February 2017, in what was the first public-to-private transaction in which a private equity fund partnered with a business founder to complete a tender offer for 100% of a company\u2019s shares, and to subsequently delist the business from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p> <p>Following its investment, Abris, together with the management team, focused on implementing a broad range of value creation initiatives, including operational improvements, commercial strategy implementation, developing and strengthening the sales and marketing functions and investing significantly in capex programs.</p> <p>Utham Gowda, Group Chief Executive Officer, Captain Fresh, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cWe are pleased to welcome Koral to the Captain Fresh group. This acquisition is a strategic milestone in our mission to become the leading tech-enabled multi-species, multi-origin global seafood conglomerate. The European market is one of the most exciting VAP (value-added product) opportunities in seafood globally. Koral augments our earlier acquisition of France-based Senecrus, adding marquee Polish and German retailer brands to our portfolio of offerings. Koral\u2019s \u2018smoked\u2019 format capability complements Senecrus\u2019 \u2018cooking\u2019 format capability. We are also thrilled to mark our foray into the salmon value chain, which is one of the largest segments within the seafood industry. With seasoned leaders Boguslaw Kowalski and Justyna Frankowska leading our global salmon strategy, we are gearing up for the next phase of growth.\u201d</p> <p></em></p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-agrees-sale-of-koral-to-captain-fresh/\">Abris agrees sale of Koral to Captain Fresh</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-agrees-sale-of-koral-to-captain-fresh/feed/ 0 Abris Capital to exit Dot2Dot in trade sale https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-capital-to-exit-dot2dot-in-trade-sale/ https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-capital-to-exit-dot2dot-in-trade-sale/#respond Iwona Wardecka Thu, 18 Jul 2024 04:50:04 +0000 Uncategorized https://abris-capital.com/?p=3513 <p>ESG transformation specialist agrees sale of premium packaging producer to Belgium\u2019s Van Genechten 18 July 2024, Warsaw \u2013 Abris Capital Partners (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has signed an agreement to sell 100% of the shares in Dot2Dot, the largest independent premium packaging producer in Central Europe, to Van&#8230;</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-capital-to-exit-dot2dot-in-trade-sale/\">Abris Capital to exit Dot2Dot in trade sale</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> <p>ESG transformation specialist agrees sale of premium packaging producer to Belgium\u2019s Van Genechten</p> <p><strong>18 July 2024, Warsaw \u2013</strong> <a href=\"http://www.abris-capital.com/\">Abris Capital Partners</a> (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has signed an agreement to sell 100% of the shares in Dot2Dot, the largest independent premium packaging producer in Central Europe, to Van Genechten Packaging, a leading European folding carton solutions provider, headquartered in Belgium and with 12 production plants across Europe. The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance.</p> <p>Headquartered in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, Dot2Dot manufactures and sells complex and innovative packaging products to customers throughout Europe, covering all sectors of the economy, from beauty and personal care to food and non-food packaging. Customers include some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, including many renowned global brands. The company has 350 employees across two facilities in Poland. Dot2Dot Is also an ESG champion, offering to its clients sustainable products and operating a modern and inclusive business model.</p> <p>Edgar Kolesnik, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>Alongside the enormously dedicated and determined management and the broader senior team, we successfully completed the transformation of Dot2Dot from three founder-led businesses into an integrated company with well-diversified sales, two modern production plants, a strong culture and unified technology standards. We are pleased that the company is in fantastic shape to move into the next phase of its growth story with Van Genechten.\u201d</em></p> <p>Abris\u2019 partnership with Dot2Dot began in June 2015, with the acquisition of Graf-Poz, a Poznan-based manufacturer of paperboard premium packaging. The company provided a strong platform for consolidating a number of complementary businesses into a single, major supplier of premium packaging products to blue-chip clients. In April 2016, Abris completed two further acquisitions, of Druk Markuszewscy, based in Gdansk, and Drukpol, based near Warsaw. This widened the group\u2019s product offering and strengthened its competitive position, at the same time creating the largest independent premium packaging producer in the Central Europe region.</p> <p>During the course of its investment, Abris has transformed Dot2Dot from a group of family-owned businesses with different cultures and technology into a modern, multi-site production company with plants in Gdansk and Warsaw, and a particular strength in key sectors including beauty, personal care and confectionary. Abris has focused on improving corporate governance, including bringing in a new CEO, CSO, CPSO and CFO, as well as more than 30 other senior positions.</p> <p>The company has also performed exceptionally well on ESG during the course of Abris\u2019 investment. In 2023, Dot2Dot generated 94% of its revenue from reusable, recyclable or compostable products, avoiding more than 83 million units of plastic packaging, and reducing carbon emission per million euros of revenue by more than 50% versus 2022. In addition, more than 50% of senior managers at Dot2Dot are women. The company won the Grand Prix award at the 2024 Abris Capital Partners ESG Awards.</p> <p>Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said:<br /> <em>\u201cOur investment in Dot2Dot showcases the impact of private equity at its very best.

(\u201cScanmed\u201d), a leading private healthcare provider in Poland, to American Heart of Poland Group backed by Gruppo San Donato, an Italian hospital group. The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance.</p> <p>Headquartered in Warsaw, Scanmed is the largest privately owned diversified in-patient group in Poland, operating 37 facilities across the country, including seven hospitals and 18 medical centers, and employing around 1,300 physicians. Abris acquired the business in 2021 with a plan to build a national healthcare champion by improving and growing the group\u2019s service offering in areas including cardiology, oncology, orthopedics and ophthalmology, and by expanding its country-wide geographic coverage.</p> <p>Wojciech Lukawski, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis has been an exceptional value creation story over the past three years, as we have worked hard to transform Scanmed into the highest quality, fully diversified in-patient healthcare services provider in Poland. Through a combination of operational improvement, organic growth and the consolidation of several add-on acquisitions, the company has significantly exceeded the original investment case.\u201d</em></p> <p>Early in the investment period, Abris took the decision to recruit a new management team, bringing in a CEO, CFO and COO with a proven track record of business improvement and organic growth, to deliver a clear strategic vision. In addition, the Supervisory Board was strengthened with independent experts providing strong supervision over the highest industry and ESG standards integration. This enabled the group to build full independence and position itself for growth as a consolidation platform.</p> <p>During Abris\u2019 ownership, the company has introduced new therapeutic areas; grown the scale of multi-profile hospitals; delivered financial and operational synergies and cooperation between different units; and increased commercial revenues to complement publicly funded activities. The company has also focused on ESG-driven transformation and accelerated capex spending in critical areas to achieve the highest medical and operating standards. As a result, the quality of services and customer experience has increased, with patients now receiving much better, more coordinated and quicker treatment.</p> <p>During its investment, Abris also supported Scanmed with an ambitious buy-and-build program, completing the add-on acquisitions of ARS Medical in 2022, Med-Lux in 2023, and Centrum Rehabilitacji in Chorz\u00f3w and Vital Medic in 2024. These transactions enabled the group to continue delivering its above-market growth strategy by increasing its footprint and number of facilities, treating over 560,000 patients annually, expanding into new regions of Poland and covering a more diverse range of therapeutic areas. The company is an important player within Poland&#8217;s national healthcare system, cooperating successfully with the National Health Fund.</p> <p>Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said:<br /> <em>\u201cOver the past three years, we have supported the creation of a versatile, regional provider of high-quality healthcare services in Poland. The combination of our ESG expertise and healthcare sector knowledge has enabled us to lead the transition towards best-in-class medical services and patient experience, as well as focusing on integrating the highest ESG standards. It has been a privilege to partner with experienced managers and the first-class medical team at Scanmed. We are confident they will have the opportunity to greatly contribute to the further development of the American Heart of Poland, not only in Poland but also across Europe.\u201d</em></p> <p>Andrzej Podlipski, CEO of Scanmed, added:<br /> <em>\u201cWe would like to thank Abris for their enormous contribution to what has been a highly productive partnership over the past three years. As a group, we have focused hard on the quality of our facilities and services, on strengthening our long-term relationships with local communities, and on creating a better working environment for medical personnel.

The report, now in its sixth year, also looks at Abris\u2019 proprietary ESG-enabled EBITDA reporting methodology and details the firm\u2019s progress on carbon footprint reduction, which has seen its portfolio reduce CO2 emissions by 38.8% per million euros of revenue over the past year.</p> <p>Pawe\u0142 Gierynski, Managing Partner at Abris Capital, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cOur annual ESG reports are an important opportunity to reflect on the progress we have made, learn from our experiences and set out new priorities for the coming years. This year\u2019s report is particularly significant, as we launch our ESG Universe 2026 strategy and use data to showcase how our ESG efforts are having a strong positive impact on financial performance.

Over the past six years, Abris has implemented the first two iterations, which have focused on building an ESG framework integrated into the investment process, education, impact measurement and reporting. The third version, ESG Universe 2026, now addresses data, seeking to establish a correlation between ESG and financial performance through a unique methodology for calculating ESG-enabled EBITDA across all portfolio companies.</p> <p>In addition to directing the internal focus towards data-driven methodologies and targets, ESG Universe 2026 will also enhance portfolio strategies with innovative sustainability opportunities, strengthen portfolio and fund ESG reporting, and support portfolio teams with ESG knowledge sharing and promotion of best practices through the Abris ESG Academy. In addition, Abris will continue to promote ESG best practice standards in Central Europe and across the continent through its involvement in committees at industry bodies Invest Europe and Sustainable Investment Forum Poland (POLSIF) and via the B Corp network \u2013 the most prestigious, globally recognized ESG certification for businesses, which Abris joined last year.</p> <p>Robert Sroka, Partner at Abris, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cEstablishing a link between ESG initiatives and financial performance is a crucial step to demonstrating just how important sustainability should be for all investors. As part of the preparation for ESG Universe 2026, we conducted a case study at portfolio company Alsendo, a Polish logistics business. Alongside the rapid expansion of the business, through both organic growth and M&amp;A, Alsendo has successfully embarked on a comprehensive ESG transformation journey over recent years. Calculations showed that in 2022, ESG initiatives underwrote approximately 23% of the company\u2019s EBITDA.\u201d</em></p> <p>Abris\u2019 ESG Report 2023 also looks in depth at the firm\u2019s DEI Code, launched last year \u2013 which aims to assist in building value for Abris and its portfolio companies through best practice in diversity, equity and inclusion \u2013 and covers \u201cDEI Talks\u201d, a series of seven educational films produced with the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion Alliance to serve as an inspiration for the portfolio companies, leaders, employees and the wider ecosystem.

It is the third year in succession that Abris has been shortlisted for the ESG category.</p> <p>The award comes in recognition of what was a banner year for ESG at Abris, during which the firm continued on its path to carbon neutrality, reducing CO2 emissions by 38.8% per million euros of revenue across its portfolio.</p> <p>During 2023, Abris was granted B Corp status \u2013 the most prestigious, globally recognized ESG accreditation for businesses that demonstrate the highest standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability. Abris is the first and only private equity fund in Central Europe to achieve this accreditation, which was granted after a rigorous 18-month approval process.</p> <p>Abris was further rewarded when its then portfolio company, Velvet CARE \u2013 Central Europe\u2019s fastest-growing consumer tissue producer \u2013 was also certified as a B Corp, becoming the first company in the Abris portfolio to become a B Corp. Velvet CARE is Europe\u2019s only large tissue producer (more than 250 employees) to be registered as a B Corp, in what is an extremely challenging sector to receive accreditation.</p> <p>Last October, Abris also launched its DEI Code \u2013 a series of commitments that aims to assist in building value for Abris and its portfolio companies through best practice in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The DEI Code sets out six key commitments, covering education, governance, ownership and process, and culminating with a commitment from Abris to take on the role of DEI leadership, promoting inclusion across the private equity ecosystem.</p> <p>Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner at Abris, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cWe are delighted that Abris has been recognized for its leadership in ESG best practice in European private equity. For us, ESG is a guiding principle, and has been central to our investment philosophy for a number of years. We aim to continue setting standards in this area, and in the coming months look forward to launching our latest flagship strategy, ESG Universe 2026.\u201d</em></p> <p>The honour from the Private Equity Awards is the latest recognition of Abris\u2019 industry-leading ESG program. In recent years the firm has been decorated by ESG Investing, for Best ESG Investment \u2013 Private Equity in 2022, Private Equity News, which has named ESG Partner Robert Sroka as one of its 20 Most Influential in ESG for the past two years and the Drawdown, which has shortlisted Sroka for its ESG Professional of the Year title for the past three years, including an overall victory in 2022.

The firm \u2013 now certified as a B Corp \u2013 saw two portfolio companies through to successful exits, having provided capital and strategic and operational support, while simultaneously using its signature focus on ESG to add further value. Managing partner Pawel Gierynski, and partner and chief financial officer Stephen Richmond, discuss the year with Real Deals.</p> <p><strong>How did Central Europe perform as a region in 2023? Pawel Gierynski: On a relative basis, Central Europe performed very well last year and I believe that, for the foreseeable future, it will continue to grow faster than the rest of Europe.</strong></p> <p><strong><br /> Pawel Gierynski: </strong>On a relative basis, Central Europe performed very well last year and I believe that, for the foreseeable future, it will continue to grow faster than the rest of Europe.<br /> First, there is the ongoing process of convergence with the rest of the EU. Second, the massive movement of EU manufacturing here, initially driven by cheaper labour costs but now by the availability of a well-educated, well-trained workforce of all levels, combined with strong productivity. Third, the reversal of globalisation. Today, businesses are more concerned about supply chain security than cost, which means European companies are keeping manufacturing close to home.<br /> Finally, there is the war in Ukraine. When the war began in 2022, many business decisions in the region were delayed. The continuation of the war in 2023 was a tragedy from a humanitarian perspective, but the direct impact on Central Europe was lower than expected. The prevailing logic has been that investments and other business steps that would otherwise have been completed should now go forward, because the war will not change anything.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Richmond:</strong> There were some challenges in 2023, including the significantly increased cost of debt and tightening covenants. But Poland, for example, still saw more M&amp;A transactions in Q1-3 than in the same periods in 2022 and 2021. Trends we observed were a noticeable shift away from mega- transactions and towards the mid- cap space, and a large number of transactions being put on hold due to mismatches in valuations between buyer and seller.</p> <p><strong>How would you summarise Abris\u2019s performance in 2023? </strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski: </strong>Overall, 2023 was one of the best years that we have had. We had two very good exits: Graal, a leading Polish canned fish producer, at the beginning of the year; and Velvet Care, Poland\u2019s leading tissue manufacturer in December. We also made several acquisitions and bolt-ons, and saw very good performance in terms of growth across the whole portfolio.</p> <p><strong>Richmond: </strong>Thanks to our disciplined approach to value creation, both companies we exited performed extremely well during our investment, with Velvet Care growing sales by 2.5x and Ebitda by more than 5.5x.</p> <p><strong>Can you talk more about one of those successful exits?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski: </strong>The exit of Velvet Care symbolises our approach to making investments. It was a specialised deal, requiring a deep understanding of an industry and strategy, and was not a process where we could just rely on advisers.<br /> About \u20ac130m was invested in capital expenditure during this investment, modernising the factory\u2019s processes and expanding capacity to meet local and international sales growth. We aimed to increase productivity by using the most sophisticated technology and machinery, and by enabling vertical integration \u2013 that is, from making paper tissue to finishing a final sellable product. Overall, the changes required a massive redesign process, including taking into account new sustainability trends and how the industry will evolve in the coming years.<br /> It is also important to mention that we committed to making the factory Co2 neutral. We did this because carbon neutrality is one of the pillars of our value creation path. In addition, potential buyers signalled that without evidence of a clear route to carbon neutrality, they would pull out because a Co2 challenge would jeopardise future value.</p> <p><strong>How has ESG been a value driver in general for Abris in 2023?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski:</strong> ESG is hugely important in driving value in our investments. For these reasons, we have developed a proprietary software platform for managing ESG integration through 500 different measures that help us to assess our portfolio companies. This is important because, at exit, our portfolio companies will be compared to best practice in ESG in their industry.<br /> The bigger the gap between our company and this standard, the bigger the discount we will have to offer to potential investors. If, as we hope, there is no gap, we will not need to offer a discount.</p> <p><strong>How significant for Abris is its achievement of B Corp status this year?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski: </strong>Greenwashing is a common problem across various markets and private equity is no different. Therefore, we wanted the most reputable and recognised confirmation of our ESG efforts, hence our decision to apply for B Corp certification. I am extremely proud of receiving this certification, following two years of hard work for our team.</p> <p><strong>How has the use of technology helped Abris create value in 2023?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski:</strong> I prefer data to anecdotes, so we try to use data as much as possible. At Abris, we centralised the reporting system that connects data from the portfolio companies to our central database and generates analytics and management reports. These reports are critical for investment evaluation and decision-making. Similarly, we strongly encourage all our portfolio companies to digitalise their businesses and enhance their operations with modern tools.</p> <p><strong>Is there anything else that you would like to mention?</strong></p> <p><strong>Richmond:</strong> We expect to see a greater focus across the market on more cautious deal-sourcing, operational improvement and organic growth. Some have described this as \u201cmaking returns the hard way\u201d but it is how we have always worked. As this has been a key element of our value proposition up until now, we are well placed to continue delivering strong results for investors going forwards.</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/getting-down-to-work/\">Getting down to work</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> https://abris-capital.com/news/getting-down-to-work/feed/ 0 Abris-backed Scanmed buys Polish healthcare business https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-backed-scanmed-buys-polish-healthcare-business/ https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-backed-scanmed-buys-polish-healthcare-business/#respond Iwona Wardecka Wed, 31 Jan 2024 10:41:01 +0000 Uncategorized https://abris-capital.com/?p=3418 <p>Acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji will strengthen Scanmed\u2019s transition to become the largest independent healthcare provider in Poland 31 January 2024, Warsaw \u2013 Abris Capital Partners (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has supported Scanmed, a Polish healthcare business, in acquiring 100% of the shares in Centrum Rehabilitacji Sp. z o.o.,&#8230;</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-backed-scanmed-buys-polish-healthcare-business/\">Abris-backed Scanmed buys Polish healthcare business</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> <p>Acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji will strengthen Scanmed\u2019s transition to become the largest independent healthcare provider in Poland</p> <p><strong>31 January 2024, Warsaw \u2013</strong> <a href=\"http://www.abris-capital.com/\">Abris Capital Partners</a> (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has supported <a href=\"https://scanmed.pl/\">Scanmed</a>, a Polish healthcare business, in acquiring 100% of the shares in <a href=\"http://centrum-rehabilitacji.net/\">Centrum Rehabilitacji Sp. z o.o.</a>, a fast-growing rehabilitation provider in Poland. The acquisition follows that of Med-Lux in November, and is part of Abris\u2019 strategy to create the leading independent medical provider in Poland.</p> <p>Centrum Rehabilitacji runs its centre in Chorz\u00f3w, offering comprehensive rehabilitation treatment services, including manual therapy, physical therapy and rehabilitation programmes. The company has been providing medical services for over 20 years, treating more than 20,000 patients annually. Centrum Rehabilitacji boasts a strong team therapists and doctors implementing a modern and comprehensive cardiac care programme.</p> <p>Sylwester Urbanek, Investment Director at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThe acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji is another step in our ambitious buy-and-build strategy for Scanmed. This is the second acquisition in recent months and the third since our investment in Scanmed. Our goal is to build a medical group providing modern and comprehensive patient care. We are delighted to welcome Centrum Rehabilitacji on board and we look forward to continuing to build the quality of care we provide in key therapeutic areas.\u201d</em></p> <p>The acquisition will significantly strengthen the implementation of the Scanmed&#8217;s strategy in building the highest standards of cardiology in Poland, in particular under Coordinated Specialized Care (KOS-Zawa\u0142). This programme focuses on supplementing hospitalisation with constant cardiac care and rehabilitation, and has a mortality rate up to two times lower than seen in patients that do not receive such care.</p> <p>Abris acquired <a href=\"https://abris-capital.com/investments/scanmed/\">Scanmed</a> in 2020 with a plan to build a local healthcare champion by improving and growing the group\u2019s service offering in areas including cardiology, oncology, orthopedics and ophthalmology, and by expanding its country-wide geographic coverage. In 2023, the group \u2013 which is considered one of Poland\u2019s most trusted healthcare providers \u2013 doubled its revenues and EBITDA. In addition to last year\u2019s add-on of outpatient and rehabilitation business Med-Lux, Scanmed also completed the acquisition of cancer care provider ARS Medical at the end of 2022.</p> <p>Andrzej Podlipski, CEO of Scanmed, added:<br /> <em>\u201cScanmed has been consistently expanding its offer of medical services for many years, in the areas of medical clinics and hospitals, addressing the most common medical challenges in our country. The acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji is an important element of our strategy to offer modern healthcare in Poland. Cardiology is developing towards solutions based on a combination of emergency treatment and rehabilitation care, which is why we want to provide our patients with access to coordinated care at the highest level and the widest possible range of therapies.\u201d</em></p> <p>Healthcare is one of the five strategic sectors that Abris focuses on. Its strong fundamentals are underpinned by a rapidly ageing population in Poland and increasing governmental healthcare spending aimed at improving the quality of service and the comprehensiveness of care.

The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance. Headquartered in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, Dot2Dot manufactures and sells complex and innovative packaging products to customers throughout Europe, covering all sectors of the economy, from beauty and personal care to food and non-food packaging. Customers include some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, including many renowned global brands. The company has 350 employees across two facilities in Poland. Dot2Dot Is also an ESG champion, offering to its clients sustainable products and operating a modern and inclusive business model. Edgar Kolesnik, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented: Alongside the enormously dedicated and determined management and the broader senior team, we successfully completed the transformation of Dot2Dot from three founder-led businesses into an integrated company with well-diversified sales, two modern production plants, a strong culture and unified technology standards. We are pleased that the company is in fantastic shape to move into the next phase of its growth story with Van Genechten.\u201d Abris\u2019 partnership with Dot2Dot began in June 2015, with the acquisition of Graf-Poz, a Poznan-based manufacturer of paperboard premium packaging. The company provided a strong platform for consolidating a number of complementary businesses into a single, major supplier of premium packaging products to blue-chip clients. In April 2016, Abris completed two further acquisitions, of Druk Markuszewscy, based in Gdansk, and Drukpol, based near Warsaw. This widened the group\u2019s product offering and strengthened its competitive position, at the same time creating the largest independent premium packaging producer in the Central Europe region. During the course of its investment, Abris has transformed Dot2Dot from a group of family-owned businesses with different cultures and technology into a modern, multi-site production company with plants in Gdansk and Warsaw, and a particular strength in key sectors including beauty, personal care and confectionary. Abris has focused on improving corporate governance, including bringing in a new CEO, CSO, CPSO and CFO, as well as more than 30 other senior positions. The company has also performed exceptionally well on ESG during the course of Abris\u2019 investment. In 2023, Dot2Dot generated 94% of its revenue from reusable, recyclable or compostable products, avoiding more than 83 million units of plastic packaging, and reducing carbon emission per million euros of revenue by more than 50% versus 2022. In addition, more than 50% of senior managers at Dot2Dot are women. The company won the Grand Prix award at the 2024 Abris Capital Partners ESG Awards. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said: \u201cOur investment in Dot2Dot showcases the impact of private equity at its very best. Despite encountering challenges during the early phase of the investment period, our long-term focus allowed us to build a strong partnership with Dot2Dot. We have created a modern, innovative and sustainable leader in the sector \u2013 the largest independent premium packaging producer in Central Europe \u2013 and delivered a positive result for our investors.\u201d Prof. Dr. Frank Ohle, CEO of Van Genechten Packaging, said: \u201cApart from sharing the same DNA, we are leveraging our capabilities in several strategic market segments. With this acquisition, we are not only strengthening our European market position in premium packaging but also significantly extending our multinational customer base. We look forward to a successful collaboration and the exciting opportunities ahead.\u201d Krzysztof Roslaniec, CEO of Dot2Dot, added: \u201cI would like to thank the entire team at Dot2Dot for their dedication over recent years, as well as to the team at Abris, without whom our transformation into the leading player in our sector would not have been possible. We are looking forward to the next stage in our journey with Van Genechten, and to continuing to provide the best quality products and services for our customers across the globe.\u201d Back to News page Media contact GlobalHydra Strategy Sam Barton *protected email* PolandSpectator PR Karol Chorazy *protected email* Jakub Zadrozny *protected email* RomaniaPR House Valeria Tudor *protected email* Contact Legal Sitemap LinkedIn \u00a9 Abris Capital Partners 2024"

The launch follows Abris\u2019 accreditation as a B Corp earlier this year, when it became the first private equity house in Central Europe to achieve this status. The DEI Code sets out six key commitments, covering education, governance, ownership and process, and culminating with a commitment from Abris to take on the role of DEI leadership, promoting inclusion across the private equity ecosystem. The Code also encompasses DEI recommendations that advisors and other contractors should adhere to when working with Abris. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, commented: \u201cPeople determine whether we succeed or fail. By putting people first, by ensuring we understand their needs and by building an organisation that accommodates everyone as equals, we will better respond to the challenges of a changing world, as well as optimising value creation in our portfolio companies. This is why we have developed our DEI Code.\u201d The Code \u2013 created by the Abris DEI Working Group in partnership with external experts \u2013 has been designed as a practical programme, where tangible results can be observed and measured through Abris\u2019 proprietary ESG Scoring Application. This enables the firm to maximise the programme\u2019s impact, and therefore its ability to transform diverse intellectual potential into inclusive teams with the ability to perform at the highest level. The six commitments, which Abris aims to achieve across its portfolio companies, starting in 2023, are: Creating a culture of \u201cDEI Readiness\u201d through education, internal dialogue and the application of best market practices. Ensuring at least 30% of the underrepresented gender in the composition of supervisory boards and leadership of portfolio companies. Appointing the Chief People Officer (CPO) as a Management Board member in each portfolio company to elevate HR and DEI topics to the strategic level. Building formalised and transparent HR systems with industry relevant DEI chapters in each portfolio company. Prioritising constant learning based on monitoring and reporting via the ESG Scoring Application. Promoting DEI in the private equity ecosystem, taking leadership on building DEI into relationships with advisors. Abris strives to take a leadership role in the development of ESG in private equity. Already, DEI programmes implemented by the firm have delivered tangible results; the proportion of women in management roles at portfolio companies rose from 26% in 2021 to 49% in 2022, and over the past year every Abris business has conducted DEI training. The aim of the DEI Code is to build on these positive results, to improve inclusion, and to demonstrate best practice across the firm\u2019s entire portfolio. Robert Sroka, Value Enhancement Partner at Abris, added: \u201cDEI is possibly the hardest element of ESG to get right, but one of the most important. Aside from the clear societal reasons for focusing DEI, research clearly shows that diverse teams perform better than uniform ones \u2013 often by a big margin. However, our aim is not just diversity, but genuine inclusion. When we achieve truly inclusive workplaces, management decisions, strategic direction and HR policies will all be shaped by diverse, united, motivated, aware and engaged teams. That is our ultimate goal.\u201d Founded in 2007, Abris seeks to partner with leading mid-market businesses in Central Europe, always balancing strong business growth with an ESG-focused culture, carbon neutrality, DEI commitments and digital excellence. Since formally launching its ESG strategy, Abris has created a range of innovative flagship programmes that support value creation and risk mitigation, including its Corporate Governance Model, Anti-Corruption Program, Climate Manifesto, Human Rights Policy and now its DEI Code.

(\u201cScanmed\u201d), a leading private healthcare provider in Poland, to American Heart of Poland Group backed by Gruppo San Donato, an Italian hospital group. The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance. Headquartered in Warsaw, Scanmed is the largest privately owned diversified in-patient group in Poland, operating 37 facilities across the country, including seven hospitals and 18 medical centers, and employing around 1,300 physicians. Abris acquired the business in 2021 with a plan to build a national healthcare champion by improving and growing the group\u2019s service offering in areas including cardiology, oncology, orthopedics and ophthalmology, and by expanding its country-wide geographic coverage. Wojciech Lukawski, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented: \u201cThis has been an exceptional value creation story over the past three years, as we have worked hard to transform Scanmed into the highest quality, fully diversified in-patient healthcare services provider in Poland. Through a combination of operational improvement, organic growth and the consolidation of several add-on acquisitions, the company has significantly exceeded the original investment case.\u201d Early in the investment period, Abris took the decision to recruit a new management team, bringing in a CEO, CFO and COO with a proven track record of business improvement and organic growth, to deliver a clear strategic vision. In addition, the Supervisory Board was strengthened with independent experts providing strong supervision over the highest industry and ESG standards integration. This enabled the group to build full independence and position itself for growth as a consolidation platform. During Abris\u2019 ownership, the company has introduced new therapeutic areas; grown the scale of multi-profile hospitals; delivered financial and operational synergies and cooperation between different units; and increased commercial revenues to complement publicly funded activities. The company has also focused on ESG-driven transformation and accelerated capex spending in critical areas to achieve the highest medical and operating standards. As a result, the quality of services and customer experience has increased, with patients now receiving much better, more coordinated and quicker treatment. During its investment, Abris also supported Scanmed with an ambitious buy-and-build program, completing the add-on acquisitions of ARS Medical in 2022, Med-Lux in 2023, and Centrum Rehabilitacji in Chorz\u00f3w and Vital Medic in 2024. These transactions enabled the group to continue delivering its above-market growth strategy by increasing its footprint and number of facilities, treating over 560,000 patients annually, expanding into new regions of Poland and covering a more diverse range of therapeutic areas. The company is an important player within Poland\u2019s national healthcare system, cooperating successfully with the National Health Fund. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said: \u201cOver the past three years, we have supported the creation of a versatile, regional provider of high-quality healthcare services in Poland. The combination of our ESG expertise and healthcare sector knowledge has enabled us to lead the transition towards best-in-class medical services and patient experience, as well as focusing on integrating the highest ESG standards. It has been a privilege to partner with experienced managers and the first-class medical team at Scanmed. We are confident they will have the opportunity to greatly contribute to the further development of the American Heart of Poland, not only in Poland but also across Europe.\u201d Andrzej Podlipski, CEO of Scanmed, added: \u201cWe would like to thank Abris for their enormous contribution to what has been a highly productive partnership over the past three years. As a group, we have focused hard on the quality of our facilities and services, on strengthening our long-term relationships with local communities, and on creating a better working environment for medical personnel. We now look forward to working with the American Heart of Poland and Gruppo San Donato, which will be a fantastic home for the top-notch medical team we have built and will enable us to continue growing and serving more patients every year.\u201d Healthcare is one of the five strategic sectors that Abris focuses on. It is underpinned by a rapidly ageing population in Poland and increasing government healthcare spending aimed at improving the quality of services and the comprehensiveness of care. Abris\u2019 previous investments in the sector include Matexlab, a Swiss vendor of innovative aesthetic medicine products, and Dentotal Protect, the leading distributor of dental consumables, instruments and equipment in Romania and Bulgaria.

B Corp status is the most prestigious, globally recognized ESG accreditation for businesses that demonstrate the highest standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability through a rigorous assessment process. The certification is awarded by B Lab, the not-for-profit behind the B Corporation movement. In order to receive certification, organizations must reach a set threshold in an Impact Assessment scoring exercise and pass B Lab\u2019s risk review. They must also make a legal commitment by changing their corporate governance structure to be accountable to all stakeholders, and exhibit transparency by allowing information about their performance to be publicly available on their profile on B Lab\u2019s website. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, commented: \u201cAs the guardian of 10.5 million jobs in Europe, we believe that private equity must invest sustainably and demonstrate the highest ethical standards in everything it does. B Corp certification is highly prized and globally recognized, and supports our mission to be the partner of choice for businesses in Central Europe and investors worldwide. By being part of this influential global movement, we hope to further build trust with consumers and communities; attract and retain employees; and draw mission-aligned investors. We hope to inspire other firms, as well as further our own education and commitment to sustainable investing.\u201d Founded in 2007, Abris seeks to partner with leading mid-market businesses in Central Europe, always balancing strong business growth with an ESG-focused culture, carbon neutrality, DEI commitments and digital excellence.

B Corp status is the most prestigious, globally recognized ESG accreditation for businesses that demonstrate the highest standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability through a rigorous assessment process. The certification is awarded by B Lab, the not-for-profit behind the B Corporation movement. In order to receive certification, organizations must reach a set threshold in an Impact Assessment scoring exercise and pass B Lab\u2019s risk review. They must also make a legal commitment by changing their corporate governance structure to be accountable to all stakeholders, and exhibit transparency by allowing information about their performance to be publicly available on their profile on B Lab\u2019s website. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, commented: \u201cAs the guardian of 10.5 million jobs in Europe, we believe that private equity must invest sustainably and demonstrate the highest ethical standards in everything it does. B Corp certification is highly prized and globally recognized, and supports our mission to be the partner of choice for businesses in Central Europe and investors worldwide.

The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly office approval and excludes Koral\u2019s fresh and smoked fish business, produced under the Superfish brand and private label. Headquartered in Wejherowo, Graal manufactures a wide range of canned and chilled fish-based products, as well as meat-based prepared foods. It produces branded products under the Graal, Neptun and Kuchnia Staropolska brands, and is a major private label supplier. The company will be acquired by Lisner Holding Sp. z o.o., which belongs to the German food business M\u00fcller Group (Unternehmensgruppe Theo M\u00fcller). Abris is exiting its investment following a six-year investment period during which the company has grown revenues and Ebitda consistently, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical challenges.

It has been a privilege to work with the extraordinary team at Graal. We are proud of what we have achieved together and are delighted that the business has found such a complementary partner in Lisner to continue its growth strategy\u201d. Abris acquired a majority stake in Graal in February 2017, in what was the first public-to-private transaction in which a private equity fund partnered with a business founder to complete a tender offer for 100% of a company\u2019s shares, and to subsequently delist the business from the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Since its investment, Abris has focused on implementing a broad range of value creation initiatives, including operational improvements, commercial strategy implementation, developing and strengthening the sales and marketing functions and investing significantly in capex programs. Graal Group (consisted of Graal and Koral) now operates from three manufacturing facilities and a distribution center in Poland, employing more than 2,200 people, and exports to 38 countries across Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia. The Group recorded sales of PLN 1.6bn (EUR 350m) in 2022. Bogus\u0142aw Kowalski, CEO and founder of Graal commented: \u201cI\u2019m grateful to Abris, my business partner, for all we have jointly achieved over the past six years, which is more than we thought possible. After 33 years of development of the company, I will step aside at Graal after short transition period. Graal and its management is now looking forward to joining forces with Lisner.

The transaction is subject to European clearance. Headquartered in Klucze, Poland, Velvet CARE manufactures paper hygiene products including tissues, toilet paper and kitchen paper towels, and is the owner of the highly regarded Velvet brand in Poland. The company was established in 2013 but its origins date to 1897, including a period of 17 years under the ownership of International Paper and Kimberly Clark. During Abris\u2019 investment, Velvet CARE has grown sales by 2.5 times and EBITDA by more than five times, and expanded its export business fivefold, significantly exceeding the original investment case in terms of financial results and strategic development. In 2020, the company completed the add-on acquisition of Moracell, the largest manufacturer of paper hygiene products in the Czech Republic. Thanks to a comprehensive ESG programme, Velvet CARE received B Corp certification \u2013 the most prestigious, globally recognised ESG accreditation for businesses that demonstrate the highest standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability \u2013 in 2023. The company also received a gold medal from Ecovadis, an independent sustainability rating agency. Tomasz Kujawa, an Investment Director at Abris, commented: \u201cWe are delighted to have had such a successful partnership with Velvet CARE\u2019s management team, supporting the company\u2019s expansion in Central Europe and beyond. During our investment, we have focused on transforming the business into a leading regional, vertically integrated player, capitalising on the growing demand for personal care and hygiene products, as well as expanding the company\u2019s export business, tapping into neighbouring markets, and integrating the highest ESG standards based on our ESG value creation methodology.\u201d Abris acquired a majority stake in Velvet CARE in 2018 from Avallon, a Polish private equity fund. Shortly after the acquisition, Velvet CARE completed a major capital expenditure programme, adding to its facilities one of the most modern tissue paper machines in Central Europe, which substantially increased its production capacity. Abris partnered with the company\u2019s management to drive organic growth, while seeking to acquire other attractive tissue businesses in the region. After the Moracell acquisition, which brought to the group a modern conversion machinery park, infrastructure and an established team in the Czech and Slovakian markets, Velvet CARE subsequently invested in another new tissue paper machine to further expand its production capacities and reinforce its position as Central Europe\u2019s market leader. Today, Velvet CARE has more than 850 employees based at its manufacturing facilities in Klucze and Zabcice, and at its commercial office in Warsaw. Its products are now sold in 30 countries. Artur Pielak, CEO of Velvet CARE, comments: \u201cOur close working relationship with Abris over the past five years has allowed us to significantly strengthen our market position. During this time Velvet CARE has grown stronger, going far beyond our initial ambitions. The management team and I can\u2019t wait to begin working with Partners Group and continuing our mission of building a European leader in this sector. This is yet another era of new possibilities for us and we plan to accelerate our growth, actively participating in the further consolidation of the paper market and seeking opportunities to expand, within Central Europe and beyond.\u201d Milorad Andelic, Member of Management, Private Equity Goods & Products Industry Vertical, Partners Group, added: \u201cVelvet CARE\u2019s extensive offering of staple products give the Company resilience and cash flow stability during macroeconomic slowdowns. At the same time, Velvet CARE\u2019s markets have strong, long-term tailwinds, with rising incomes driving demand for both premium and value products.

The transaction is subject to Lithuanian antimonopoly clearance.</p> <p>Founded in 2014 and based in Vilnius, Kaunas and Klaip\u0117da, Visas transportas UAB handles around 20,000 orders per month. The company has two products: the Siusk24 parcel platform, serving primarily small and medium B2X clients; and the Cargobooking platform, which handles larger cargoes and freight. The acquisition has a strong strategic rationale, supporting Alsendo\u2019s international expansion and giving the business an immediate footprint in the Baltic parcel services market.</p> <p>The transaction follows Alsendo\u2019s earlier add-ons of: Sendit, a parcel services platform in Poland (July 2021); Zaslat, a technology-enabled parcel services platform focused on consumers and corporate clients in the Czech Republic and Slovakia (September 2022); Innoship, a Romanian SaaS carrier management software provider (October 2022); and Ecolet, a B2X focused parcel services platform in Romania (April 2023).</p> <p>Edgar Kolesnik, partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis is another step in Alsendo\u2019s journey to build the largest tech-enabled delivery management solutions provider in Central Europe. We are committed to achieving further international growth and driving investment in value creation, and the acquisition of Siusk24 and Cargobooking supports these goals. We remain focused on our ambitious buy-and-build strategy, and sustainable development of the organization through technological enhancement, international expansion and team integration.\u201d</em></p> <p>The acquisition of Visas transportas UAB will support Alsendo&#8217;s cross-border operations as an e-commerce enabler through access to new customer groups, known-how and technology, at the same time as allowing the business to deliver potential synergies. In addition, it supports Alsendo\u2019s position as a logistics technology sector consolidator across Central Europe, bringing in new geographies and unlocking cross-selling potential across the wider group.</p> <p>Abris originally acquired Alsendo (then called apaczka) in November 2020, with a plan to capitalize on the ongoing growth of e-commerce globally, at the same time executing an ambitious organic and acquisitive expansion program. Alsendo is now the largest delivery management solutions provider in Central Europe, operating as an end-to-end multi-carrier shipment intermediary dedicated to e-commerce platforms, marketplaces, global enterprises and SMEs, cooperating with the leading players in the regional courier delivery market.</p> <p>Magda Magnuszewska, CEO of Alsendo, added:<br /> <em>\u201cWe are happy to welcome the Siusk24 and Cargobooking teams and business to the Alsendo family. This is the most recent stage of our consolidation of the logistics sector in Central Europe. We have built a wealth of experience integrating businesses into the Alsendo platform and we continue to pursue our strategy of transitioning to a technology-driven, sustainable business model and expanding internationally.\u201d</em></p> <p>Egidijus Breik\u0161tas, CEO and Co-Founder of Visas transportas UAB, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis is an exciting development for Siusk24 and Cargobooking, bringing us into a wider group, which will allow us to unlock new growth opportunities and support Alsendo as it seeks to drive international expansion in the cross-border segment.

The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly and other regulatory approvals.</p> <p>The agreement sees Abris sign a partnership with Captain Fresh, India\u2019s leading tech-led seafood supply chain company backed by major investors, including Tiger Global Management, Prosus Ventures, British International Investment, Z47 (fka Matrix Partners India), Accel, SBI Holdings, Evolvence Group, Ankur Capital and Incubate Fund. Koral will become a key platform for the international market development of salmon products within the Captain Fresh group, in which Abris will take a stake.</p> <p>Based in Kukinia in Poland, Koral manufactures smoked salmon products that are sold across Poland and internationally. The company has 26 production lines, processing 120 tons of fish daily. The partnership with Captain Fresh follows Abris\u2019 separate exit of the Graal business to German food business M\u00fcller Group, which was agreed in February 2023.</p> <p>Kamil Gajdzi\u0144ski, Investment Manager at Abris, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis partnership between Koral and Captain Fresh is further evidence of the fantastic potential of Central European businesses and the growing appetite of international conglomerates for investment opportunities in the region. This has been a successful collaboration for Abris, Bogus\u0142aw Kowalski, Graal and Koral, and we are pleased that we have found the ideal partner in Captain Fresh, which will drive international growth and further consolidation in this sector.&#8221;</em></p> <p>The transaction with Captain Fresh follows a seven-year investment period, during which Koral has grown revenues and Ebitda consistently, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical challenges. Abris acquired a majority stake in Graal and Koral in February 2017, in what was the first public-to-private transaction in which a private equity fund partnered with a business founder to complete a tender offer for 100% of a company\u2019s shares, and to subsequently delist the business from the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p> <p>Following its investment, Abris, together with the management team, focused on implementing a broad range of value creation initiatives, including operational improvements, commercial strategy implementation, developing and strengthening the sales and marketing functions and investing significantly in capex programs.</p> <p>Utham Gowda, Group Chief Executive Officer, Captain Fresh, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cWe are pleased to welcome Koral to the Captain Fresh group. This acquisition is a strategic milestone in our mission to become the leading tech-enabled multi-species, multi-origin global seafood conglomerate. The European market is one of the most exciting VAP (value-added product) opportunities in seafood globally. Koral augments our earlier acquisition of France-based Senecrus, adding marquee Polish and German retailer brands to our portfolio of offerings. Koral\u2019s \u2018smoked\u2019 format capability complements Senecrus\u2019 \u2018cooking\u2019 format capability. We are also thrilled to mark our foray into the salmon value chain, which is one of the largest segments within the seafood industry. With seasoned leaders Boguslaw Kowalski and Justyna Frankowska leading our global salmon strategy, we are gearing up for the next phase of growth.\u201d</p> <p></em></p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-agrees-sale-of-koral-to-captain-fresh/\">Abris agrees sale of Koral to Captain Fresh</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-agrees-sale-of-koral-to-captain-fresh/feed/ 0 Abris Capital to exit Dot2Dot in trade sale https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-capital-to-exit-dot2dot-in-trade-sale/ https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-capital-to-exit-dot2dot-in-trade-sale/#respond Iwona Wardecka Thu, 18 Jul 2024 04:50:04 +0000 Uncategorized https://abris-capital.com/?p=3513 <p>ESG transformation specialist agrees sale of premium packaging producer to Belgium\u2019s Van Genechten 18 July 2024, Warsaw \u2013 Abris Capital Partners (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has signed an agreement to sell 100% of the shares in Dot2Dot, the largest independent premium packaging producer in Central Europe, to Van&#8230;</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-capital-to-exit-dot2dot-in-trade-sale/\">Abris Capital to exit Dot2Dot in trade sale</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> <p>ESG transformation specialist agrees sale of premium packaging producer to Belgium\u2019s Van Genechten</p> <p><strong>18 July 2024, Warsaw \u2013</strong> <a href=\"http://www.abris-capital.com/\">Abris Capital Partners</a> (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has signed an agreement to sell 100% of the shares in Dot2Dot, the largest independent premium packaging producer in Central Europe, to Van Genechten Packaging, a leading European folding carton solutions provider, headquartered in Belgium and with 12 production plants across Europe. The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance.</p> <p>Headquartered in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, Dot2Dot manufactures and sells complex and innovative packaging products to customers throughout Europe, covering all sectors of the economy, from beauty and personal care to food and non-food packaging. Customers include some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, including many renowned global brands. The company has 350 employees across two facilities in Poland. Dot2Dot Is also an ESG champion, offering to its clients sustainable products and operating a modern and inclusive business model.</p> <p>Edgar Kolesnik, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>Alongside the enormously dedicated and determined management and the broader senior team, we successfully completed the transformation of Dot2Dot from three founder-led businesses into an integrated company with well-diversified sales, two modern production plants, a strong culture and unified technology standards. We are pleased that the company is in fantastic shape to move into the next phase of its growth story with Van Genechten.\u201d</em></p> <p>Abris\u2019 partnership with Dot2Dot began in June 2015, with the acquisition of Graf-Poz, a Poznan-based manufacturer of paperboard premium packaging. The company provided a strong platform for consolidating a number of complementary businesses into a single, major supplier of premium packaging products to blue-chip clients. In April 2016, Abris completed two further acquisitions, of Druk Markuszewscy, based in Gdansk, and Drukpol, based near Warsaw. This widened the group\u2019s product offering and strengthened its competitive position, at the same time creating the largest independent premium packaging producer in the Central Europe region.</p> <p>During the course of its investment, Abris has transformed Dot2Dot from a group of family-owned businesses with different cultures and technology into a modern, multi-site production company with plants in Gdansk and Warsaw, and a particular strength in key sectors including beauty, personal care and confectionary. Abris has focused on improving corporate governance, including bringing in a new CEO, CSO, CPSO and CFO, as well as more than 30 other senior positions.</p> <p>The company has also performed exceptionally well on ESG during the course of Abris\u2019 investment. In 2023, Dot2Dot generated 94% of its revenue from reusable, recyclable or compostable products, avoiding more than 83 million units of plastic packaging, and reducing carbon emission per million euros of revenue by more than 50% versus 2022. In addition, more than 50% of senior managers at Dot2Dot are women. The company won the Grand Prix award at the 2024 Abris Capital Partners ESG Awards.</p> <p>Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said:<br /> <em>\u201cOur investment in Dot2Dot showcases the impact of private equity at its very best.

(\u201cScanmed\u201d), a leading private healthcare provider in Poland, to American Heart of Poland Group backed by Gruppo San Donato, an Italian hospital group. The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance.</p> <p>Headquartered in Warsaw, Scanmed is the largest privately owned diversified in-patient group in Poland, operating 37 facilities across the country, including seven hospitals and 18 medical centers, and employing around 1,300 physicians. Abris acquired the business in 2021 with a plan to build a national healthcare champion by improving and growing the group\u2019s service offering in areas including cardiology, oncology, orthopedics and ophthalmology, and by expanding its country-wide geographic coverage.</p> <p>Wojciech Lukawski, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThis has been an exceptional value creation story over the past three years, as we have worked hard to transform Scanmed into the highest quality, fully diversified in-patient healthcare services provider in Poland. Through a combination of operational improvement, organic growth and the consolidation of several add-on acquisitions, the company has significantly exceeded the original investment case.\u201d</em></p> <p>Early in the investment period, Abris took the decision to recruit a new management team, bringing in a CEO, CFO and COO with a proven track record of business improvement and organic growth, to deliver a clear strategic vision. In addition, the Supervisory Board was strengthened with independent experts providing strong supervision over the highest industry and ESG standards integration. This enabled the group to build full independence and position itself for growth as a consolidation platform.</p> <p>During Abris\u2019 ownership, the company has introduced new therapeutic areas; grown the scale of multi-profile hospitals; delivered financial and operational synergies and cooperation between different units; and increased commercial revenues to complement publicly funded activities. The company has also focused on ESG-driven transformation and accelerated capex spending in critical areas to achieve the highest medical and operating standards. As a result, the quality of services and customer experience has increased, with patients now receiving much better, more coordinated and quicker treatment.</p> <p>During its investment, Abris also supported Scanmed with an ambitious buy-and-build program, completing the add-on acquisitions of ARS Medical in 2022, Med-Lux in 2023, and Centrum Rehabilitacji in Chorz\u00f3w and Vital Medic in 2024. These transactions enabled the group to continue delivering its above-market growth strategy by increasing its footprint and number of facilities, treating over 560,000 patients annually, expanding into new regions of Poland and covering a more diverse range of therapeutic areas. The company is an important player within Poland&#8217;s national healthcare system, cooperating successfully with the National Health Fund.</p> <p>Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said:<br /> <em>\u201cOver the past three years, we have supported the creation of a versatile, regional provider of high-quality healthcare services in Poland. The combination of our ESG expertise and healthcare sector knowledge has enabled us to lead the transition towards best-in-class medical services and patient experience, as well as focusing on integrating the highest ESG standards. It has been a privilege to partner with experienced managers and the first-class medical team at Scanmed. We are confident they will have the opportunity to greatly contribute to the further development of the American Heart of Poland, not only in Poland but also across Europe.\u201d</em></p> <p>Andrzej Podlipski, CEO of Scanmed, added:<br /> <em>\u201cWe would like to thank Abris for their enormous contribution to what has been a highly productive partnership over the past three years. As a group, we have focused hard on the quality of our facilities and services, on strengthening our long-term relationships with local communities, and on creating a better working environment for medical personnel.

The report, now in its sixth year, also looks at Abris\u2019 proprietary ESG-enabled EBITDA reporting methodology and details the firm\u2019s progress on carbon footprint reduction, which has seen its portfolio reduce CO2 emissions by 38.8% per million euros of revenue over the past year.</p> <p>Pawe\u0142 Gierynski, Managing Partner at Abris Capital, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cOur annual ESG reports are an important opportunity to reflect on the progress we have made, learn from our experiences and set out new priorities for the coming years. This year\u2019s report is particularly significant, as we launch our ESG Universe 2026 strategy and use data to showcase how our ESG efforts are having a strong positive impact on financial performance.

Over the past six years, Abris has implemented the first two iterations, which have focused on building an ESG framework integrated into the investment process, education, impact measurement and reporting. The third version, ESG Universe 2026, now addresses data, seeking to establish a correlation between ESG and financial performance through a unique methodology for calculating ESG-enabled EBITDA across all portfolio companies.</p> <p>In addition to directing the internal focus towards data-driven methodologies and targets, ESG Universe 2026 will also enhance portfolio strategies with innovative sustainability opportunities, strengthen portfolio and fund ESG reporting, and support portfolio teams with ESG knowledge sharing and promotion of best practices through the Abris ESG Academy. In addition, Abris will continue to promote ESG best practice standards in Central Europe and across the continent through its involvement in committees at industry bodies Invest Europe and Sustainable Investment Forum Poland (POLSIF) and via the B Corp network \u2013 the most prestigious, globally recognized ESG certification for businesses, which Abris joined last year.</p> <p>Robert Sroka, Partner at Abris, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cEstablishing a link between ESG initiatives and financial performance is a crucial step to demonstrating just how important sustainability should be for all investors. As part of the preparation for ESG Universe 2026, we conducted a case study at portfolio company Alsendo, a Polish logistics business. Alongside the rapid expansion of the business, through both organic growth and M&amp;A, Alsendo has successfully embarked on a comprehensive ESG transformation journey over recent years. Calculations showed that in 2022, ESG initiatives underwrote approximately 23% of the company\u2019s EBITDA.\u201d</em></p> <p>Abris\u2019 ESG Report 2023 also looks in depth at the firm\u2019s DEI Code, launched last year \u2013 which aims to assist in building value for Abris and its portfolio companies through best practice in diversity, equity and inclusion \u2013 and covers \u201cDEI Talks\u201d, a series of seven educational films produced with the Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion Alliance to serve as an inspiration for the portfolio companies, leaders, employees and the wider ecosystem.

It is the third year in succession that Abris has been shortlisted for the ESG category.</p> <p>The award comes in recognition of what was a banner year for ESG at Abris, during which the firm continued on its path to carbon neutrality, reducing CO2 emissions by 38.8% per million euros of revenue across its portfolio.</p> <p>During 2023, Abris was granted B Corp status \u2013 the most prestigious, globally recognized ESG accreditation for businesses that demonstrate the highest standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability. Abris is the first and only private equity fund in Central Europe to achieve this accreditation, which was granted after a rigorous 18-month approval process.</p> <p>Abris was further rewarded when its then portfolio company, Velvet CARE \u2013 Central Europe\u2019s fastest-growing consumer tissue producer \u2013 was also certified as a B Corp, becoming the first company in the Abris portfolio to become a B Corp. Velvet CARE is Europe\u2019s only large tissue producer (more than 250 employees) to be registered as a B Corp, in what is an extremely challenging sector to receive accreditation.</p> <p>Last October, Abris also launched its DEI Code \u2013 a series of commitments that aims to assist in building value for Abris and its portfolio companies through best practice in diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). The DEI Code sets out six key commitments, covering education, governance, ownership and process, and culminating with a commitment from Abris to take on the role of DEI leadership, promoting inclusion across the private equity ecosystem.</p> <p>Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner at Abris, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cWe are delighted that Abris has been recognized for its leadership in ESG best practice in European private equity. For us, ESG is a guiding principle, and has been central to our investment philosophy for a number of years. We aim to continue setting standards in this area, and in the coming months look forward to launching our latest flagship strategy, ESG Universe 2026.\u201d</em></p> <p>The honour from the Private Equity Awards is the latest recognition of Abris\u2019 industry-leading ESG program. In recent years the firm has been decorated by ESG Investing, for Best ESG Investment \u2013 Private Equity in 2022, Private Equity News, which has named ESG Partner Robert Sroka as one of its 20 Most Influential in ESG for the past two years and the Drawdown, which has shortlisted Sroka for its ESG Professional of the Year title for the past three years, including an overall victory in 2022.

The firm \u2013 now certified as a B Corp \u2013 saw two portfolio companies through to successful exits, having provided capital and strategic and operational support, while simultaneously using its signature focus on ESG to add further value. Managing partner Pawel Gierynski, and partner and chief financial officer Stephen Richmond, discuss the year with Real Deals.</p> <p><strong>How did Central Europe perform as a region in 2023? Pawel Gierynski: On a relative basis, Central Europe performed very well last year and I believe that, for the foreseeable future, it will continue to grow faster than the rest of Europe.</strong></p> <p><strong><br /> Pawel Gierynski: </strong>On a relative basis, Central Europe performed very well last year and I believe that, for the foreseeable future, it will continue to grow faster than the rest of Europe.<br /> First, there is the ongoing process of convergence with the rest of the EU. Second, the massive movement of EU manufacturing here, initially driven by cheaper labour costs but now by the availability of a well-educated, well-trained workforce of all levels, combined with strong productivity. Third, the reversal of globalisation. Today, businesses are more concerned about supply chain security than cost, which means European companies are keeping manufacturing close to home.<br /> Finally, there is the war in Ukraine. When the war began in 2022, many business decisions in the region were delayed. The continuation of the war in 2023 was a tragedy from a humanitarian perspective, but the direct impact on Central Europe was lower than expected. The prevailing logic has been that investments and other business steps that would otherwise have been completed should now go forward, because the war will not change anything.</p> <p><strong>Stephen Richmond:</strong> There were some challenges in 2023, including the significantly increased cost of debt and tightening covenants. But Poland, for example, still saw more M&amp;A transactions in Q1-3 than in the same periods in 2022 and 2021. Trends we observed were a noticeable shift away from mega- transactions and towards the mid- cap space, and a large number of transactions being put on hold due to mismatches in valuations between buyer and seller.</p> <p><strong>How would you summarise Abris\u2019s performance in 2023? </strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski: </strong>Overall, 2023 was one of the best years that we have had. We had two very good exits: Graal, a leading Polish canned fish producer, at the beginning of the year; and Velvet Care, Poland\u2019s leading tissue manufacturer in December. We also made several acquisitions and bolt-ons, and saw very good performance in terms of growth across the whole portfolio.</p> <p><strong>Richmond: </strong>Thanks to our disciplined approach to value creation, both companies we exited performed extremely well during our investment, with Velvet Care growing sales by 2.5x and Ebitda by more than 5.5x.</p> <p><strong>Can you talk more about one of those successful exits?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski: </strong>The exit of Velvet Care symbolises our approach to making investments. It was a specialised deal, requiring a deep understanding of an industry and strategy, and was not a process where we could just rely on advisers.<br /> About \u20ac130m was invested in capital expenditure during this investment, modernising the factory\u2019s processes and expanding capacity to meet local and international sales growth. We aimed to increase productivity by using the most sophisticated technology and machinery, and by enabling vertical integration \u2013 that is, from making paper tissue to finishing a final sellable product. Overall, the changes required a massive redesign process, including taking into account new sustainability trends and how the industry will evolve in the coming years.<br /> It is also important to mention that we committed to making the factory Co2 neutral. We did this because carbon neutrality is one of the pillars of our value creation path. In addition, potential buyers signalled that without evidence of a clear route to carbon neutrality, they would pull out because a Co2 challenge would jeopardise future value.</p> <p><strong>How has ESG been a value driver in general for Abris in 2023?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski:</strong> ESG is hugely important in driving value in our investments. For these reasons, we have developed a proprietary software platform for managing ESG integration through 500 different measures that help us to assess our portfolio companies. This is important because, at exit, our portfolio companies will be compared to best practice in ESG in their industry.<br /> The bigger the gap between our company and this standard, the bigger the discount we will have to offer to potential investors. If, as we hope, there is no gap, we will not need to offer a discount.</p> <p><strong>How significant for Abris is its achievement of B Corp status this year?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski: </strong>Greenwashing is a common problem across various markets and private equity is no different. Therefore, we wanted the most reputable and recognised confirmation of our ESG efforts, hence our decision to apply for B Corp certification. I am extremely proud of receiving this certification, following two years of hard work for our team.</p> <p><strong>How has the use of technology helped Abris create value in 2023?</strong></p> <p><strong>Gierynski:</strong> I prefer data to anecdotes, so we try to use data as much as possible. At Abris, we centralised the reporting system that connects data from the portfolio companies to our central database and generates analytics and management reports. These reports are critical for investment evaluation and decision-making. Similarly, we strongly encourage all our portfolio companies to digitalise their businesses and enhance their operations with modern tools.</p> <p><strong>Is there anything else that you would like to mention?</strong></p> <p><strong>Richmond:</strong> We expect to see a greater focus across the market on more cautious deal-sourcing, operational improvement and organic growth. Some have described this as \u201cmaking returns the hard way\u201d but it is how we have always worked. As this has been a key element of our value proposition up until now, we are well placed to continue delivering strong results for investors going forwards.</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/getting-down-to-work/\">Getting down to work</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> https://abris-capital.com/news/getting-down-to-work/feed/ 0 Abris-backed Scanmed buys Polish healthcare business https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-backed-scanmed-buys-polish-healthcare-business/ https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-backed-scanmed-buys-polish-healthcare-business/#respond Iwona Wardecka Wed, 31 Jan 2024 10:41:01 +0000 Uncategorized https://abris-capital.com/?p=3418 <p>Acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji will strengthen Scanmed\u2019s transition to become the largest independent healthcare provider in Poland 31 January 2024, Warsaw \u2013 Abris Capital Partners (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has supported Scanmed, a Polish healthcare business, in acquiring 100% of the shares in Centrum Rehabilitacji Sp. z o.o.,&#8230;</p> <p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com/news/abris-backed-scanmed-buys-polish-healthcare-business/\">Abris-backed Scanmed buys Polish healthcare business</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://abris-capital.com\">Abris Capital Partners</a>.</p> <p>Acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji will strengthen Scanmed\u2019s transition to become the largest independent healthcare provider in Poland</p> <p><strong>31 January 2024, Warsaw \u2013</strong> <a href=\"http://www.abris-capital.com/\">Abris Capital Partners</a> (\u201cAbris\u201d), the ESG transformation specialist private equity investor and B Corp, has supported <a href=\"https://scanmed.pl/\">Scanmed</a>, a Polish healthcare business, in acquiring 100% of the shares in <a href=\"http://centrum-rehabilitacji.net/\">Centrum Rehabilitacji Sp. z o.o.</a>, a fast-growing rehabilitation provider in Poland. The acquisition follows that of Med-Lux in November, and is part of Abris\u2019 strategy to create the leading independent medical provider in Poland.</p> <p>Centrum Rehabilitacji runs its centre in Chorz\u00f3w, offering comprehensive rehabilitation treatment services, including manual therapy, physical therapy and rehabilitation programmes. The company has been providing medical services for over 20 years, treating more than 20,000 patients annually. Centrum Rehabilitacji boasts a strong team therapists and doctors implementing a modern and comprehensive cardiac care programme.</p> <p>Sylwester Urbanek, Investment Director at Abris Capital Partners, commented:<br /> <em>\u201cThe acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji is another step in our ambitious buy-and-build strategy for Scanmed. This is the second acquisition in recent months and the third since our investment in Scanmed. Our goal is to build a medical group providing modern and comprehensive patient care. We are delighted to welcome Centrum Rehabilitacji on board and we look forward to continuing to build the quality of care we provide in key therapeutic areas.\u201d</em></p> <p>The acquisition will significantly strengthen the implementation of the Scanmed&#8217;s strategy in building the highest standards of cardiology in Poland, in particular under Coordinated Specialized Care (KOS-Zawa\u0142). This programme focuses on supplementing hospitalisation with constant cardiac care and rehabilitation, and has a mortality rate up to two times lower than seen in patients that do not receive such care.</p> <p>Abris acquired <a href=\"https://abris-capital.com/investments/scanmed/\">Scanmed</a> in 2020 with a plan to build a local healthcare champion by improving and growing the group\u2019s service offering in areas including cardiology, oncology, orthopedics and ophthalmology, and by expanding its country-wide geographic coverage. In 2023, the group \u2013 which is considered one of Poland\u2019s most trusted healthcare providers \u2013 doubled its revenues and EBITDA. In addition to last year\u2019s add-on of outpatient and rehabilitation business Med-Lux, Scanmed also completed the acquisition of cancer care provider ARS Medical at the end of 2022.</p> <p>Andrzej Podlipski, CEO of Scanmed, added:<br /> <em>\u201cScanmed has been consistently expanding its offer of medical services for many years, in the areas of medical clinics and hospitals, addressing the most common medical challenges in our country. The acquisition of Centrum Rehabilitacji is an important element of our strategy to offer modern healthcare in Poland. Cardiology is developing towards solutions based on a combination of emergency treatment and rehabilitation care, which is why we want to provide our patients with access to coordinated care at the highest level and the widest possible range of therapies.\u201d</em></p> <p>Healthcare is one of the five strategic sectors that Abris focuses on. Its strong fundamentals are underpinned by a rapidly ageing population in Poland and increasing governmental healthcare spending aimed at improving the quality of service and the comprehensiveness of care.

The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance. Headquartered in Gda\u0144sk, Poland, Dot2Dot manufactures and sells complex and innovative packaging products to customers throughout Europe, covering all sectors of the economy, from beauty and personal care to food and non-food packaging. Customers include some of the world\u2019s largest corporations, including many renowned global brands. The company has 350 employees across two facilities in Poland. Dot2Dot Is also an ESG champion, offering to its clients sustainable products and operating a modern and inclusive business model. Edgar Kolesnik, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented: Alongside the enormously dedicated and determined management and the broader senior team, we successfully completed the transformation of Dot2Dot from three founder-led businesses into an integrated company with well-diversified sales, two modern production plants, a strong culture and unified technology standards. We are pleased that the company is in fantastic shape to move into the next phase of its growth story with Van Genechten.\u201d Abris\u2019 partnership with Dot2Dot began in June 2015, with the acquisition of Graf-Poz, a Poznan-based manufacturer of paperboard premium packaging. The company provided a strong platform for consolidating a number of complementary businesses into a single, major supplier of premium packaging products to blue-chip clients. In April 2016, Abris completed two further acquisitions, of Druk Markuszewscy, based in Gdansk, and Drukpol, based near Warsaw. This widened the group\u2019s product offering and strengthened its competitive position, at the same time creating the largest independent premium packaging producer in the Central Europe region. During the course of its investment, Abris has transformed Dot2Dot from a group of family-owned businesses with different cultures and technology into a modern, multi-site production company with plants in Gdansk and Warsaw, and a particular strength in key sectors including beauty, personal care and confectionary. Abris has focused on improving corporate governance, including bringing in a new CEO, CSO, CPSO and CFO, as well as more than 30 other senior positions. The company has also performed exceptionally well on ESG during the course of Abris\u2019 investment. In 2023, Dot2Dot generated 94% of its revenue from reusable, recyclable or compostable products, avoiding more than 83 million units of plastic packaging, and reducing carbon emission per million euros of revenue by more than 50% versus 2022. In addition, more than 50% of senior managers at Dot2Dot are women. The company won the Grand Prix award at the 2024 Abris Capital Partners ESG Awards. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said: \u201cOur investment in Dot2Dot showcases the impact of private equity at its very best. Despite encountering challenges during the early phase of the investment period, our long-term focus allowed us to build a strong partnership with Dot2Dot. We have created a modern, innovative and sustainable leader in the sector \u2013 the largest independent premium packaging producer in Central Europe \u2013 and delivered a positive result for our investors.\u201d Prof. Dr. Frank Ohle, CEO of Van Genechten Packaging, said: \u201cApart from sharing the same DNA, we are leveraging our capabilities in several strategic market segments. With this acquisition, we are not only strengthening our European market position in premium packaging but also significantly extending our multinational customer base. We look forward to a successful collaboration and the exciting opportunities ahead.\u201d Krzysztof Roslaniec, CEO of Dot2Dot, added: \u201cI would like to thank the entire team at Dot2Dot for their dedication over recent years, as well as to the team at Abris, without whom our transformation into the leading player in our sector would not have been possible. We are looking forward to the next stage in our journey with Van Genechten, and to continuing to provide the best quality products and services for our customers across the globe.\u201d Back to News page Media contact GlobalHydra Strategy Sam Barton *protected email* PolandSpectator PR Karol Chorazy *protected email* Jakub Zadrozny *protected email* RomaniaPR House Valeria Tudor *protected email* Contact Legal Sitemap LinkedIn \u00a9 Abris Capital Partners 2024"

The launch follows Abris\u2019 accreditation as a B Corp earlier this year, when it became the first private equity house in Central Europe to achieve this status. The DEI Code sets out six key commitments, covering education, governance, ownership and process, and culminating with a commitment from Abris to take on the role of DEI leadership, promoting inclusion across the private equity ecosystem. The Code also encompasses DEI recommendations that advisors and other contractors should adhere to when working with Abris. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, commented: \u201cPeople determine whether we succeed or fail. By putting people first, by ensuring we understand their needs and by building an organisation that accommodates everyone as equals, we will better respond to the challenges of a changing world, as well as optimising value creation in our portfolio companies. This is why we have developed our DEI Code.\u201d The Code \u2013 created by the Abris DEI Working Group in partnership with external experts \u2013 has been designed as a practical programme, where tangible results can be observed and measured through Abris\u2019 proprietary ESG Scoring Application. This enables the firm to maximise the programme\u2019s impact, and therefore its ability to transform diverse intellectual potential into inclusive teams with the ability to perform at the highest level. The six commitments, which Abris aims to achieve across its portfolio companies, starting in 2023, are: Creating a culture of \u201cDEI Readiness\u201d through education, internal dialogue and the application of best market practices. Ensuring at least 30% of the underrepresented gender in the composition of supervisory boards and leadership of portfolio companies. Appointing the Chief People Officer (CPO) as a Management Board member in each portfolio company to elevate HR and DEI topics to the strategic level. Building formalised and transparent HR systems with industry relevant DEI chapters in each portfolio company. Prioritising constant learning based on monitoring and reporting via the ESG Scoring Application. Promoting DEI in the private equity ecosystem, taking leadership on building DEI into relationships with advisors. Abris strives to take a leadership role in the development of ESG in private equity. Already, DEI programmes implemented by the firm have delivered tangible results; the proportion of women in management roles at portfolio companies rose from 26% in 2021 to 49% in 2022, and over the past year every Abris business has conducted DEI training. The aim of the DEI Code is to build on these positive results, to improve inclusion, and to demonstrate best practice across the firm\u2019s entire portfolio. Robert Sroka, Value Enhancement Partner at Abris, added: \u201cDEI is possibly the hardest element of ESG to get right, but one of the most important. Aside from the clear societal reasons for focusing DEI, research clearly shows that diverse teams perform better than uniform ones \u2013 often by a big margin. However, our aim is not just diversity, but genuine inclusion. When we achieve truly inclusive workplaces, management decisions, strategic direction and HR policies will all be shaped by diverse, united, motivated, aware and engaged teams. That is our ultimate goal.\u201d Founded in 2007, Abris seeks to partner with leading mid-market businesses in Central Europe, always balancing strong business growth with an ESG-focused culture, carbon neutrality, DEI commitments and digital excellence. Since formally launching its ESG strategy, Abris has created a range of innovative flagship programmes that support value creation and risk mitigation, including its Corporate Governance Model, Anti-Corruption Program, Climate Manifesto, Human Rights Policy and now its DEI Code.

But from \nthe perspective we have today, post-Covid Europe seems pretty similar to the pre-pan-\ndemic landscape. \nWe use more technology, exercise sanitary caution, and keep our distance a little more. \nAnd while there have been job losses and challenging conditions in certain industries, \nthere have also been some positive aspects, such as better financed healthcare infra-\nstructure and more time spent with families. As 2021 closed out, the biggest challenges \nseemed manageable, and people moved to a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d mode of operating. \nBut just as we started congratulating ourselves for our flexibility and resilience over \nthe past two years, February 24th happened, and a major political, humanitarian, and \neconomic catastrophe unfolded in Ukraine following Russia\u2019s unprovoked invasion. From \nthat day on, we have had to reassess how our world is changing \u2013 in Europe and across \nthe globe \u2013 on an almost daily basis. \nWhether we are sitting in Warsaw, London, Helsinki or Washington, this crisis relates to all \nof us and threatens many aspects of our lives. One thing that makes me feel comforted \nis the fact that all of us here in the European Union, as well as in the US, are standing \ntogether and working hand-in-hand to support our friends and protect our future. Last \nyear, agility was the most critical aspect of our business. But today, despite the macro \nsituation or perhaps even because of it, the most important thing is \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \nKeep going. Deliver.\nOur ESG focus in 2021 was centered around \nthe ESG 2023 Universe project, with particular \nattention paid to the execution of our Climate \nManifesto. \nAll our portfolio companies are now very familiar with measurement and reduction of \ncarbon footprints and understand and efficiently operate reporting tools. Together, \nthese companies form a regional vanguard of sustainability champions, and our target \nof full neutrality in 2025 remains unchanged. \nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nESG Report 2021  |  Introduction\nI am grateful to all our management teams for their work, which helps Abris, as a finan-\ncial institution, demonstrate its full readiness to operate under new EU SFDR regulations. \nThis achievement is incredibly important for our sustainability. \n2021 was also a breakthrough year for our portfolio in terms of multidimensional value \nenhancement. I was very impressed to see so many digitization projects executed, es-\npecially in the cyber security and Human Resources management areas. Today, digital \nmanagement tools are a must-have, and such broad buy-in proves how professional \nand courageous our managers are. And since digital is the new reality, we saw several \nrebranding and digital marketing campaigns in 2021, helping to connect our businesses \nto their respective markets in a more effective way. All these projects feed into our ESG \nplans and are documented in our Scoring Application as evidence of value creation.\nFinally, I would like to reveal a small part of what the future holds for our ESG efforts. \nIn\u00a02022 we have created a dedicated taskforce to explore the topic of diversity, equity \nand inclusion (DEI). Our ambition is to deliver a comprehensive DEI program across our \nportfolio that will unite, empower and energize our teams, but at the same time help \nbuild stronger businesses. \nI hope you will read the 2021 edition of our ESG Report with interest and join me in ap-\npreciating the tremendous work done by all the people involved - the Abris team, the \nportfolio teams and our investors for the continuous encouragement they give us to \nreach even higher. \nSo far, 2022 has already brought Abris the best ESG Private Equity fund in Europe Award. \nThis seals and closes a chapter for us. But as always, \u201cthe end\u201d is a good place to start \nthe next challenge.\nSincerely,\nPawel Gierynski\nManaging Partner\n Abris Capital Partners\n10\n11\nemployed in the \nportfolio\nAbris Capital Partners\n11\nAbris is one of the leading independent private \nequity fund managers investing in Central  \nEurope, building regional champions through \nESG transformation.

Our specialization, ESG transformation, \nis one of the key building blocks of strong \nperformance.\nTo achieve our goals, we have developed \na\u00a0comprehensive ESG strategy - Abris ESG \nUniverse 2023. \nThree pillars of ESG Universe 2023\n\u2022\t Pillar I \u2013 Abris as a model organization\n\u2022\t Pillar II \u2013 End-to-end processes \n\u2022\t Pillar III \u2013 ESG thought leader\nOur strategy has also been planned to adhere \nmore closely to the UN Sustainable Develop-\nment Goals. \nOur strategic ESG activities that build the value \nof our investments, also support the achieve-\nment of sustainable development goals. Abris \nfocuses on supporting the following SDGs:\nSDG 12\t Responsible Consumption and \n\t\nProduction\nSDG 13\t Climate Change\nSDG 3\t\nGood Health and well-being\nSDG 5\t\nGender Equality\nSDG 8\t\nDecent Work and Economic Growth\nSDG 9\t\nIndustry Innovation and Infrastructure\nSDG 16\t Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions\nS\nG\nE\nESG UNIVERSE 2023 STRATEGY - \nwe know where we are going\nThe foundation of this strategy is the Abris \nClimate Manifesto, in which we set out our \ntarget to achieve climate neutrality across our \nentire investment portfolio by 2025.\nAbris\u2019 ESG Universe sets out our \nresponsible strategy for the coming \nyears. \nESG Universe 2023 provides a comprehensive, \noverarching structure for all our ESG work. It \nencompasses 17 projects across four key cat-\negories: governance and culture; standards; \neducation; and carbon neutrality. \nGovernance and culture \u2013 Abris has built a \nclear, well-defined, and fully tested approach \nto integrating ESG into its investment activity. \nWe aim to be pragmatic and practical while \noptimizing risk management and value cre-\nation. Every procedure and tool we create is \nrequired to prove its efficiency and purpose. \nTherefore, the first pillar of this strategy is about \nmaking Abris a role model organization for our \nportfolio companies and for the wider private \nequity ecosystem. Our internal governance \nand culture must allow for consistent delivery \nof that purpose. \nStandards - We strive to improve our current \ntools and develop new ones to strengthen \nefficiency and sharpen the decision-making \nprocess. By creating a database of all ESG \nprocedures, we build the knowledge and \nexperience of the team. We develop models \nin individual ESG areas and are clear about \nour points of reference, in order to allow us to \nevaluate the effectiveness of our activities.\nEducation - Knowledge allows us to build \nawareness, and awareness allows for rational \nand effective actions. We have built an exten-\nsive ESG knowledge base for the Abris team \nand are investing more in education for Abris \nstaff and for our portfolio companies.\nCarbon neutrality - Since carbon footprint \nreduction should be one of the most important \nmissions for every management team across \nthe world, we want Abris to be a frontrunner for \nprivate equity in this area. Our ambition is to \nachieve a carbon neutral portfolio by 2025. \n \nESG thought \nleader\nEnd-to-end  \nESG \nprocesses\nAbris as \na model ESG \norganization\nESG Report 2021  |  Abris as a responsible investor\n 20\nClimate change is one of the most significant \nchallenges currently facing humanity. Under \nthe Paris Agreement, countries have agreed to \naim to hold the increase in the global average \ntemperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-in-\ndustrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the \ntemperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C. Limiting global \nwarming is the higher aim of the Paris Agree-\nment and is necessary in order to mitigate the \nmost severe long-term economic and environ-\nmental consequences of climate change.\nAbris recognises that business has a vital role \nto play in addressing climate change, and that \nits actions can deliver economic, social and \nenvironmental benefits over the long term.\nTo mitigate the worst effects of climate \nchange, all companies will need to plan for \ncarbon neutrality. The costs associated with \nthis change are an obligation for future in-\nvestors. As well as being the right thing to do, \naddressing them today will also make our \nbusinesses more valuable.\nIn 2021 Abris launched its Climate Manifesto \u2013 \na\u00a0plan to reach carbon neutrality across our \nportfolio by 2025, to prepare for net zero and \nto ensure that all our portfolio companies lead \nthe field in terms of sustainable investment.\nCLIMATE MANIFESTO \u2013 \nwe know what is \nmost important\nKey actions of Abris\u2019 Climate Manifesto:\nFrom 2022, Abris\u2019 Warsaw \noffice is 100% carbon neutral\n1.\t Achieving carbon neutrality at Abris by 2023 \nAs a responsible investor, we are committed to becoming carbon \nneutral in our own operations by 2023 \n \n2.\t Developing an effective balancing model by 2023 \nWe aim to develop a carbon-neutral balancing model for our entire \ninvestment portfolio, to ensure each new company is able to reach \nits carbon-neutral goal \n \n3.\t Achieving a carbon-neutral portfolio by 2025 \nWe will create ambitious reduction action plans and a catalog of \noffset initiatives for our portfolio companies in order to achieve \na\u00a0carbon-neutral portfolio by 2025 \n \n4.\t Developing an agile climate change strategy \nfor our portfolio companies \nTogether with our portfolio companies, we will adopt \nstrategies for climate change and build a resilience plan based on \nTCFD recommendations \n \n5.\t Building a net zero strategy pathway for our \nportfolio companies by 2030 \nFollowing each successful exit, Abris will provide each portfolio \ncompany with a detailed action plan on how to address \nthe transition to net zero\n Abris Capital Partners\n22\n23\nThe strategic goals defined in Abris\u2019 ESG \nUniverse 2023 are interconnected.

This \nmeans creating an effective ESG governance \nstructure and developing the standards and \ntools that make our ESG activities effective. \nApplying the principles of responsible invest-\nment requires an appropriate management \nsystem that ensures that ESG is part of our \nDNA. Therefore, every area of Abris, covering all \nbodies, committees, roles and decision-making \nareas within the firm, has a responsibility to in-\nclude the principles of responsible investment \nin everyday decisions and actions. \nBuilding a model ESG organization is the \nresponsibility of the entire team, supported by \nour dedicated ESG Team. We are constantly \nlearning, and we want to be better and better. \nThat is why we set up our ESG Academy, in \norder to help us gain knowledge that allows \nus to think about responsible investing not \nonly ideologically, but also pragmatically and \npractically.\nWe have a dedicated ESG Team, which is a \npart of the Value Enhancement Team, com-\nprising a Partner, the ESG Director, a Technol-\nogy Director, a Value Enhancement Manager \nand a Value Enhancement Associate.\nPillars of ESG Universe 2023 \nI.

It is a counterintuitive question. \nStarting in 2019, each year I have introduced the Abris ESG Report by talking about the chang-\nes influencing our professional and personal environment and the different initiatives we \nhave undertaken to deal with these changes. Maybe now it is time to admit that the \u201cchange\u201d \nis the new reality and reflect on what really matters when dealing with this kaleidoscope. \nAn important feature of the reality of change is its complexity and multidimensional char-\nacter. Not only do many elements \u2013 both independent and related \u2013 change at the same \ntime, but they also continually generate change mutations. Therefore, what matters most in \nbuilding an adequate and a bulletproof response to change, is to account for those different \ndimensions by encouraging diversity, by looking from different points of view, opinions, and \nrisk assessments, and weaving them into a multifaceted and inclusive solution. One person\u2019s \neyes, ears and experience are not enough. \nRiding that wave, in 2022, the Abris team accepted the challenge \nof designing a new flagship ESG programme focused on building a \ndiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) toolkit. To quote my colleagues: \nthis was one of the most difficult ESG projects we have ever un-\ndertaken. Why? DEI policies might have become as common in the \nprivate equity ecosystem as accounting standards, but unfortu-\nnately, many of them hit the target but miss the point. \nOur mission was to design a practical programme, maximizing our ability to transform diverse \nintellectual potential into inclusive teams with the ability to perform at the highest level. We \nfollowed experience-based logic, assuming that to succeed in portfolio implementation we \nneeded an emotional readiness among the people expected to lead the change, as well as \nclear decision-making governance, operational ownership, and practical guidelines. And as \nalways, we at Abris needed to lead the way. I hope readers of this report will appreciate the \nAbris DEI Code and the six key commitments that form its basis. \nSpeaking about the flagship programmes, I want to recognize the efforts of our portfolio man-\nagers in delivering the important milestones of our Climate Manifesto. In 2022, we reached the \nhalfway point in achieving carbon neutrality across our portfolio. Since launching the pro-\ngram, our portfolio companies have avoided 73,439 Mg CO2e, which represents on average a \n28% reduction of emissions per million euros of revenue. Not bad at all. \nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nAnother key project that kept our ESG and financial teams busy in 2022 was preparation for \nSFDR regulations. We chose to follow the Article 8+ regime, which brings two types of chal-\nlenges: delivering compliant documentation and populating reports with historical data.  \nI am confident that, thanks to our four years effort to build appropriate database, we will soon \nbe able to share the reports with our investors. \nPlanning for 2023 and beyond, we are looking forward to the third edition of our ESG strategy: \nESG Universe 2026. I will save the details for next year\u2019s report, but one central element to all \nour new projects will be the practical application of our value creation lessons learned.\nI am delighted to present the Abris 2022 ESG Report, which summarizes our progress in \ndelivering what we have promised. I am pleased that our efforts continue to be recognized by \nmany industry bodies as the best in the region and in Europe, but what makes me truly proud \nis that the data we collect now shows the tangible, positive impact of our work on the long-\nterm value of our portfolio. \nSo, when turning these pages, please join me in congratulating all of the Abris family \u2013 portfo-\nlio managers, investment team members, the value enhancement team and support profes-\nsionals \u2013 on delivering what stands behind this report: shareholder and stakeholder value. \nHappy reading!\nPawel Gierynski\nManaging Partner\n ESG Report 2022  |  Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\n6\n7\nAbout us\n Abris Capital Partners\n8\n9\nESG Report 2022  |  About us\nAbris Capital Partners is the leading ESG transfor-\nmation specialist private equity fund manager, \nfocused on mid-market opportunities in Central \nEurope. Established in 2007, Abris seeks to identify \nand partner with the most successful and dynamic \nmid-market businesses in the Eastern Member States \nof the European Union countries, providing capital \nand management expertise at both strategic and \noperational levels, while driving growth through ESG \ntransformation.\nFor us, there is no distinction between \u201cinvesting\u201d \nand \u201cresponsible investing\u201d. ESG factors are present \nthroughout the full investment process, and we plan, \nmonitor and measure the ESG impact on the busi-\nnesses we invest in.\nOur approach\nWe focus on transforming regional \nleaders into international champions, \nalways pairing business growth with \nan ESG-focused culture, carbon neu-\ntrality, DEI commitments and digital \nexcellence. Our mandate is to deliver \nstrong returns for investors and \ncontribute to regenerative economy \ngoals.\nOur ESG approach is centered around our ESG 2023 \nUniverse strategy, which is a comprehensive pro-\ngram of 17 initiatives across governance and culture, \nstandards, education and carbon neutrality. In 2022, \nin pursuit of the best-in-class standards within \u201cS\u201d \ncategory, we focused more closely on Diversity, \nEquity and Inclusion (DEI). We developed a new \nflagship program \u2013 the DEI Code \u2013 for Abris and our \nportfolio companies. We consider diversity as a cru-\ncial element of value creation, but we are also aware \nthat a commitment to DEI is a constant journey.

At the \nsame time, the strategy includes the ambitious target \nof achieving a carbon neutral portfolio by 2025 and \nputs in place net-zero action plans for each individual \nportfolio company, making Abris the first private equity \nhouse in Central Europe to commit to this goal. \nAbris\u2019 ESG strategy is based on three \npillars:\n\u2022\t Pillar I \u2013 Abris as a model organization - ensures that \nAbris is a model organization for both our portfolio \ncompanies and the wider private equity ecosystem \n\u2022\t Pillar II \u2013 End-to-end processes - integrates ESG \ncomponents into decision making milestones at \nevery stage of the investment process \n\u2022\t Pillar III \u2013 ESG thought leader - ensures we demon-\nstrate ESG leadership across the Central Europe \nregion, delivering best-in-class investor reporting \nand promoting ESG best practice\nTo reflect the evolution of our approach to ESG inte-\ngration and accommodate market requirements for \nstandardization and transparency, ESG Universe 2023 \nadheres closely to the UN Sustainable Development \nGoals.

From our own experience, and \nsupported by a canon of research and data, we know \nthat diverse teams build better, more resilient and \nmore profitable businesses. At Abris, we believe that \npeople, their attitude and effort determine whether \norganizations succeed or fail. Therefore, going the \nextra mile to understand and accommodate employ-\nees\u2019 needs, to create an inclusive working environment \nand to reward work in a fair and transparent way is \nthe path we choose.

This applies to DEI as much as to \nany other area of ESG, and can clearly seen in results. \nDiverse teams are happier, more cohesive, and \nperform better financially as well. \nFor CEOs, it is important to focus on the business \nbenefits, emphasizing things like increased innovation, \nexpanded market opportunities, improved employee \nengagement and retention, and better decision-mak-\ning. All of this can help company CEOs understand \nthat implementing a DEI strategy is not just the right \nthing to do from a moral standpoint, but also a smart \nbusiness decision with tangible returns on investment. \nA diverse workforce brings together individuals from \ndifferent backgrounds, perspectives and experiences. \nAs a consequence, we observe diversity of thought, \nwhich can lead to increased innovation and creativity, \nas employees with diverse viewpoints bring unique \nideas and solutions to the table. This can ultimately \nlead to improved products, services and processes \nthat can positively impact a company\u2019s bottom line. \nIn my eyes this is a motivation strong enough to build \na company\u2019s culture around DEI. But from another \nangle, even just looking at the risk mitigation side is a \nsufficient motivator for some CEOs, as they acknowl-\nedge the difference DEI can make in terms of helping \nthem to protect their businesses. There are diverse \nentry points into a DEI-oriented culture.\n2. How does DEI impact a company\u2019s \nperformance?\nDEI is linked to a company\u2019s performance in multiple \nways. To think about this another way, you could ask: \nhow is your company\u2019s culture linked to its perfor-\nmance? \nFirst, we can talk about fostering innovation and \ncreativity in teams, improving employee engage-\nment and productivity, and about capturing market \nopportunities. Or perhaps we could discuss how we \ncan better understand our customers thanks to our \ninternal diversity. Attracting and retaining top talent is \nincreasingly a big issue, especially for younger gener-\nations that are highly conscious of company culture \nand reputation. \nWe can also talk about enhancing our overall reputa-\ntion and brand image, as well as entering the area of \ncorporate activism or, looking at employer branding \nand consumers expectations \u2013 brand activism. And \nlast but not least, we can again talk about mitigating \nrisks. \nIt is clear that prioritizing DEI can contribute to a \ncompany\u2019s overall success and competitiveness. It is a \npart of a purpose-focused approach, a key branding \ntouchpoint and an absolute necessity for a company \nthat wants to thrive in the new stakeholder-oriented \nbusiness landscape. \nNo DEI equals no future.\n3. What area of DEI should companies \nfocus on in the next 1-3 years?\nSpecific areas of focus may vary depending on the \nindustry, size and positioning of a company. In order \nto determine the areas that need the most attention \nand develop a comprehensive DEI strategy that is \nrelevant to their specific circumstances, companies \nmust conduct thorough assessments, engaging with \nemployees, identifying biases and cultural contexts \nand aligning DEI efforts with the company\u2019s values and \ngoals.\nThere are, however, some universal steps that every \nbusiness should consider, starting with Inclusive Lead-\nership. Companies should prioritize in their improve-\nment plans the inclusive leadership, which involves \ncultivating leaders who demonstrate inclusive behav-\niors, are aware of unconscious biases, and actively \ncreate an inclusive culture. Providing training and \ndevelopment programs for leaders that emphasize \ninclusive leadership practices can help drive positive \nchange throughout the organization. \nThere are many specific fields where inclusive leader-\nship can play a role in improving DEI culture:\nMeasurement and Accountability: Companies should \nestablish metrics and measurements to track pro-\ngress and hold themselves accountable for their DEI \ninitiatives. This includes setting specific, measurable \nand achievable goals related to DEI, and regularly re-\nviewing and reporting on progress. Companies should \nalso create mechanisms for employees to provide \nfeedback and voice concerns related to DEI, and take \naction to address them. \nEquity and Fairness: Companies should assess their \npolicies, practices, and procedures to ensure they \nare equitable and fair. This includes evaluating hiring \npractices, pay equity, promotion processes and other \nHR policies to identify and address any potential bias-\nes or inequities that may exist within the organization. \nRepresentation and Diversity: Companies should \nfocus on increasing representation and diversity at \nall levels of their organization, including leadership \npositions. This involves actively recruiting and pro-\nmoting employees from underrepresented groups, \nsetting measurable diversity goals and implementing \nstrategies to ensure that diverse talent is retained, \ndeveloped and advanced within the company. \nInclusive Culture: Companies should work on fostering \nan inclusive culture where all employees feel valued, \nrespected and included. This could involve creating \npolicies and practices that promote inclusion, such \nas flexible work arrangements, diversity training \nprograms and initiatives that celebrate diversity, as \nwell as promoting open communication, respect for \ndiverse perspectives and a sense of belonging among \nemployees. \nAll of the above initiatives should contribute to a higher \nlevel of belonging in the organization and in my eyes \nthis is the lodestar for DEI strategies in the coming \nyears.\n Abris Capital Partners\n25\nClimate Manifesto\nAs part of our ESG Universe strategy, in 2021 Abris \nannounced its Climate Manifesto  \u2013 a roadmap for \nreaching carbon neutrality across our portfolio by \n2025 and preparing companies for net zero. The \nClimate Manifesto sets out five clear and practical \ngoals, and in order to support progress towards these \nmilestones, Abris offers portfolio companies education, \nguidelines and templates, which are ready-to-use \nand adjusted to the mid-term investment horizon. \nThe carbon neutrality is a joint commitment by each \ndeal team and portfolio management team, based \non an individually defined action plan. In the next 5 \nto 10 years, climate agility and carbon neutrality will \nbecome a critical exit factor, and key to securing \nmaximum value for investors at exit.\nThese targets align portfolio business strategies with \nthe Paris Agreement, the EU Green Deal and SDG 13.\nAbris\u2019 Climate Manifesto \u2013 \nkey actions:\n1.\t Achieve carbon neutrality at Abris \nby the end of 2023.  \n2.\t Develop an effective balancing \nmodel by the end of 2023.  \n3.\t Achieve a carbon-neutral portfolio \nby 2025.  \n4.\t Develop an agile climate change \nstrategy for our portfolio compa-\nnies.  \n5.\t Build a net zero strategy action \nplan for each portfolio company by \n2030 and ensure that all portfolio \ncompanies lead the field in terms \nof sustainable investment.\nTaks Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures \u2013 summary\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial \nDisclosures (TCFD) was created by the Financial \nStability Board to improve and increase reporting of \nclimate-related financial information.

Companies \nthat successfully manage climate-related risks will \nperform better in the long-term and attract a broader \naudience of potential investors, whether strategic or \nfinancial, at exit. \nAbris perspective\nAbris typically holds its investments for 3-5 years, and \nenvironmental factors are front of mind throughout \nthe full investment process. During the due diligence \nprocess, we review all climate-related risks and op-\nportunities to ensure we have identified all the current \nand future potential risks at the company we plan to \ninvest in. At the same time, we always include climate \ngoals in the Exit Path planning as a part of our com-\nmitment to promote environmental characteristics. \nIn future, we expect climate risk to grow as a result of \nincreasing physical climate risks, as well as transition \nrisks, such as changing climate-related guidelines and \nregulations from governments, rising energy costs and \nsupply chain interruptions. \nFor our own offices (Warsaw, Bucharest, Cyprus) we \nhave classified acute physical climate-related risks \nas low. These risks have not affected our business, \nstrategy or financial planning. \nPortfolio company perspective\nOur portfolio companies with the biggest climate \nimpact operate in the following sectors:\n\u2022\t paper-based hygiene product manufacturing\n\u2022\t recycling and industrial waste management\n\u2022\t packaging \n\u2022\t automotive trading\n\u2022\t healthcare\nPortfolio companies operating in these sectors and \nbased in CEE are the most exposed to transition risks \ndue to their high coal dependence. These include \nhigher carbon prices, regulation on emissions and \nshifts in technology and demand. Production compa-\nnies with supply chains in Asia may have been disrupt-\ned by issues with acquiring raw materials. On the other \nhand, thanks to Abris\u2019 focus on ESG transformation, \nthese companies have performed well on emissions \nreduction and making climate-related technological \nshifts.\nMarket risks, meanwhile, may result from increased \ncosts and a shift in consumer demands, which could \nresult in increased operating costs, reduced demand \nfor products and services and increased cost, and \nreduced availability of capital.\n\u2022\t Investor perspective \n\u2022\t Abris perspective\n\u2022\t Portfolio company perspective\n\u2022\t Due diligence / investment decision\n\u2022\t Investment process (3-5 years)\n\u2022\t Period after exit (6-15 years)\nAbris has dedicated ESG professionals that are responsible for climate-related risks \nand opportunities.

Our \nAbris\u2019 central goal is to achieve a carbon neutral port-\nfolio by 2025, based on the GHG Protocol Standard and \nthe Paris Agreement. That is why we count the carbon \nfootprint in Scope 1 and 2 at each portfolio company \nand in Scope 3 at companies with the highest levels \nof emissions. This allows us to analyze trends and set \npriorities for action. In particular, we analyze the use of \nrenewable energy sources, energy efficiency and in-\nvestments made to increase it, the share of renewable \nenergy in the energy mix provided by energy suppliers \nand the level of necessary off-sets.\nportfolio companies have implemented climate \nKPIs and indicators which we monitor on a quarterly \nbasis, and a full analysis of risks and opportunities is \nconducted once per year. \n\u2022\t Abris ESG governance ensures that deal teams, the \nESG team and IC are regularly involved in reviewing \nrisk maps and monitoring materiality levels.\nActions implemented to date have allowed us to \nachieve a 28% reduction in emissions per million \neuros of revenue at our portfolio companies.\nDue dilligence\nManagement \neducation & KPIs\nDeal teams \nportfolio supervision\nClimate Risk Management\nESG team quarterly \n& annual reviews\nResponsible Investment \nManagement System\nAbris as a model ESG \norganization\nInternal ESG governance structure\nWe have incorporated our Responsible Investment Pol-\nicy and our ESG Monitoring Procedure into our invest-\nment process, from due diligence all the way through \nto exit, and beyond.

This was the result of an in-depth, two-year  \ncertification process, and on May 3rd, 2023, I was genuinely proud and grateful to  \nmatch the Abris logo with the famous B Corp symbol.\nSo, where do we go from here? \nWhile the assessment of ESG standards often eludes precise measurement, the market \nnow teems with endless attempts to quantify and appraise its impact. There are so \nmany different rankings and scores out there and still so many greenwashing scandals. \nTherefore, we wanted to test our value creation methodology with something carved in \nstone; something business focused, quantitative and completely transparent. \nWith Universe 2020, we planted the tree; with Universe 2023, \nwe grew the forest; now it is time to harvest! It is the moment \nto translate our work into tangible figures, quantified in euros \nor, more precisely, in ESG-enabled EBITDA, revenues and  \nultimately valuations. \nThe new edition of our ESG strategy introduced in this report, \nUniverse 2026, will center on distilling years of gathered  \ndata and experience into concrete, documented results.  \nAs we advance in implementing that approach, we have \ndecided to strengthen our portfolio strategies with numeric \nESG targets, measurement, and data analytics. \nI am confident that our current and future investors will appreciate this approach \nand the unique value creation toolkit that we have showcased in 2023 through two \nremarkable exit successes. Furthermore, I hope readers of this report will understand the \nenhancements we implemented in 2023, putting a greater emphasis on measurement \nand data provision for each portfolio company.\nAs in the previous year, I am happy to share that our flagship Climate Manifesto  \nprogram is advancing well and continuing to deliver tangible results. The joint efforts \nof management teams and Abris have delivered a further reduction in the carbon \nfootprint across our portfolio in 2023. Our companies emitted 30,853 Mg CO2e less in \n2023 versus 2022. Since the beginning of the measurement, our portfolio avoided  \n53% Mg CO2e per million euros of revenue in 2023. \nThrough our regular Abris ESG Academy education program and by developing a \nmutual understanding of how important climate topics are for the success of portfolio \nbusinesses, we have created an outstanding community of managers promoting \nsustainability. And this comes on top of Abris itself achieving carbon neutrality in our \nWarsaw and Bucharest offices in 2023.\nAnother flagship initiative, the DEI Code, which was introduced in 2022 and executed \nthroughout 2023, continues to yield favourable outcomes. My satisfaction stems not only \nfrom the enhanced diversity metrics observed across all portfolio leadership teams but, \nmore significantly, from businesses\u2019 evident readiness to change. I am convinced that \nwe have successfully conquered the most significant obstacle we faced.\nI encourage you to read this 2023 ESG Report not only as a summary of our projects, \nachieved goals and calculated results, but especially as a testament to the tremendous \nwork done by our portfolio teams and my Abris colleagues. Every year we do this job with \none thing in mind \u2013 do better, go further and deliver more sustainable results for all our \nstakeholders.

For us, there is \nno distinction between \u201cinvesting\u201d and \u201cresponsible \ninvesting\u201d. We have incorporated our Responsible \nInvestment Policy and our ESG Monitoring Procedure \ninto our investment process from due diligence all \nthe way through to exit, and beyond. Our Responsible \nInvestment Policy defines our responsibilities, presents \nour investment process path, and defines the rules of \ntransparency. \nWe actively engage with our portfolio companies \nthroughout the investment process and embed ESG \nissues into all stages of our plan for each investment. \nWe understand that only close, long-term cooperation \nwill lead to successful outcomes at each portfolio \ncompany.\nEvery year, we review and update our approach to ESG \nby implementing new policies, programs, tools, and \nobjectives. In 2023:\nAt Abris, we decided to use our capabilities to promote \nresponsible investment throughout the region. We \nshare our experience to ensure that private equity \nfunds across Central Europe \u2013 which is home to \naround 100 million people \u2013 increasingly take into \naccount environmental, social and governance fac-\ntors when making investment decisions. We consider \nourselves to be an ESG transformation specialist, \nsetting standards for the private equity industry across \nthe region.\nFrom compliance to value creation\nIn 2023 we developed the third edition of our ESG \nUniverse strategy. Over the past six years, we have \nimplemented the first two iterations, which have \nenabled us to create an ESG portfolio model that is \nnot only effective but also repeatable. We added two \nflagships to our methodology: measurement of the \nESG impact on the portfolio businesses (Data Harvest) \nand integration of sustainable risks and opportunities \ninto portfolio strategies (Experience Harvest).\nAs a result, under ESG Universe 2026 we will focus on \nintegrating sustainability trends into each portfolio \ncompany\u2019s strategy and establishing a correlation \nbetween ESG and financial performance. This will \nbe achieved using our proprietary methodology for \nmeasuring ESG-enabled EBITDA, and other analytical \nand reporting tools. Our new, comprehensive strategy \ntraditionally includes initiatives across governance \nand culture, education, standards and data. \nAbris ESG Universe 2026 - The third chapter of our evolution\nAbris ESG Universe: Evolution \n\u2022\t Define the Abris approach to \nESG integration (three pillars)\n\u2022\t Build the Framework, \nprocesses and procedures \n(prototyping, testing, prioritiz-\ning, ongoing learning)\n\u2022\t Educate the team \n(ESG Academy, Investment \nCommittee buy-in)\n\u2022\t Conduct disciplined port-\nfolio work and recognition \n(ESG\u00a0structures, yearly plans, \nESG Awards)\n\u2022\t Measure impact (ESG Scoring \nApplication, carbon footprint \nmanagement)\n\u2022\t Communicate proactively \nwith stakeholders (LPs, PRI, \nInvest Europe, PSiK etc)\n\u2022\t Continue to develop the \nthree-pillar approach \n(Internal ESG Governance)\n\u2022\t Add new procedures to \ndeepen sophistication of \nprocesses (Exit Scenario)\n\u2022\t Continue education in more \nsystemic way; integrate \nESG into evaluation system \n(ESG\u00a0Academy)\n\u2022\t Use Universe 2020 lessons \nlearned to improve efficiency \n(Management KPIs)\n\u2022\t Develop existing tools further \n(Value Enhancement Scoring \nApplication)\n\u2022\t Build comprehensive ESG \nreporting practice (Board \nPacks, quarterly and annual \nLP reports, ESG Report)\n\u2022\t Continue to develop existing ESG/\nBCorp framework and adapt to \nthe market regulatory develop-\nments\n\u2022\t Redirect internal ESG attitude and \ntools towards data-driven meth-\nodologies and targets\n\u2022\t Enhance portfolio strategies with \ninnovative sustainability and \ndigital trends, strengthen portfolio \nand fund\u2019s reporting with ESG data\n\u2022\t Support portfolio teams with ESG \nknowledge sharing and promoting \nbest practices (ESG Academy)\n\u2022\t Acknowledge Abris\u2019 status as sus-\ntainability champion and partner \nof choice for the LPS\n\u2022\t Promote ESG standards in the \nCE Region (BCorp, POLSIF, Invest \nEurope)\nObjectives:\nObjectives:\nObjectives:\n2020\nPlant  \nthe tree\u2026\n2023\nGrow the \nforest!\n2026\nHarvest!\nwe obtained B Corp status \n\u2013 the most prestigious, \nglobally recognized ESG \naccreditation for businesses \n\u2013 making us the only private \nequity firm in Central Europe \nwith B Corp certification\ndrawing on years of \nexperience, we established \nnew goals and documented \nthem in the ESG Universe \nStrategy 2026\nwe sought to better \ndemonstrate the impact of \nESG initiatives on the value \nof our portfolio companies \nby developing a unique \nmethodology for calculating \nESG-enabled EBITDA\nHarvest!\n 18\n19\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nThree pillars of Abris ESG philosophy\nESG Universe 2026 foundation\nSince 2017, Abris\u2019 ESG Universe Strategy has been \nbased on three pillars: \nPillar I \u2013 Abris as a model ESG organization:  \npresents Abris as a model organization for our portfolio \ncompanies and the private equity industry.\nPillar II \u2013 End-to-end ESG processes:  \nensures ESG processes form a key part of deci-\nsion-making at each stage of the investment process.\nPillar III \u2013 ESG thought leader:  \npositions Abris as an ESG leader across the CEE region \nthrough best-in-class reporting and the promotion of \nESG best practices.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are a global \ncommitment to build a more inclusive, resilient, and \nenvironmentally responsible world.

The certification signifies that \na company meets rigorous standards of social and \nenvironmental performance, transparency, and \naccountability. To become a Certified B Corporation, a \ncompany must undergo an assessment process that \nevaluates its impact on various stakeholders, including \nworkers, customers, communities, and the environ-\nment. The assessment covers areas such as govern-\nance, workers\u2019 treatment, community engagement, \nenvironmental practices, and overall business impact.\nWith a score of 108.4, Abris achieved results signifi-\ncantly better than the threshold required to achieve B \nCorp status. We are now a part of a vital international \nmovement, and we hope that our recognition will \ninspire other firms to commit to sustainable investing.\nMonika Nachyla \nPartner and Head of ESG at Abris:\nPawel Nizinski \nCountry Partner for B\u00a0Lab in Poland and CEO of Better:\n\u201cThis is a significant milestone in Abris\u2019 history and  \nreflects our pioneering role in sustainable investing \nin Central Europe.

The \nstatus of actions and projects is regularly reported to the Managing Partner and \ndiscussed by the Investment Committee. \n\u2022\tInvestment Team members take responsibility for adding the climate change area \nto the due diligence process, and Exit Path.\n\u2022\tAt the portfolio company level, the ESG Coordinator is responsible for updating the \nTCFD analysis once a year and reporting any major changes to the Management \nBoard. \n \n \n\u2022\tAbris is a private equity fund that invests in and partners with companies (typically \nfor a period of 3-5 years in each case) from various sectors such as: healthcare, \ncircular economy, digital and technology, ecommerce/modern logistics, specialist \nmanufacturing. During the due diligence process, we review all climate-related \nrisks and opportunities to ensure we have identified all the current and future \npotential risks at the company we plan to invest in. At the same time, we always \ninclude climate goals in the Exit Path planning as a part of our commitment to \npromote sustainability. \n\u2022\tIn future, we expect increasing transition risks, such as changing climate-related \nguidelines and regulations from governments, rising energy costs and supply chain \ninterruptions. For our own offices (Warsaw, Bucharest, Cyprus) we have classified \nacute physical climate-related risks as low. \n\u2022\tIdentified physical risks for Abris offices will not affect our business, strategy or \nfinancial planning.\n\u2022\tOur portfolio companies are based in CEE and are exposed to transition risks due to \ntheir coal dependence. Those risks are higher carbon prices, regulation on emis-\nsions and shifts in technology. Market risks may result in increasing costs and shifts \nin consumer demands. These may in turn increase operating costs and reduce \navailability of capital. \nProprietary measurement \nof ESG-enabled EBITDA\nCompliance with \nTCFD\nThese areas support the circular economy,  \nin particular UN SDG 12:\n\u2022\t Sustainable delivery options\n\u2022\t Shipping route optimization software \n\u2022\t Software for circular economy shipments\n\u2022\t Management of consolidated shipment drop-offs\n\u2022\t Label-less shipping\nESG-enabled cost savings included:\n\u2022\t Decrease of employee attrition and lower hiring \ncosts\n\u2022\t Reduction of software platform downtime through IT \ninfrastructure and process improvements\n\u2022\t Decrease in printing and paper costs \nESG-related costs included:\n\u2022\t GDPR audits and advisory costs\n\u2022\t Whistle-blowing implementation and support\n\u2022\t ESG Officer training costs\n\u2022\t Employee satisfaction measurement costs\nIn 2023, Abris developed a new flagship program \u2013 \nESG-enabled EBITDA calculation. \nESG-enabled EBITDA assesses the impact of a com-\npany\u2019s ESG initiatives on its financial results. This might \ninclude quantifying the positive impacts of sustaina-\nbility efforts, analyzing cost savings from energy-effi-\ncient operations, evaluating the financial benefits of \nimproved employee satisfaction or retention due to \nsocial programs, or assessing the impact of strong \ngovernance on risk management and profitability.\nCase study:\nAbris used portfolio company Alsendo Group, to test \nthe ESG-enabled EBITDA calculation. \nAbris invested in Apaczka in 2020 and transformed \nit into Alsendo Group, a clear market leader within \nthe shipping technology ecosystem in CEE. Originally \nfocused on providing shipping services to small busi-\nnesses in Poland, Alsendo expanded its product offer-\ning to cover businesses of all sizes and sectors across  \nkey CEE markets. Alongside the rapid expansion of \nthe business, through both organic growth and M&A, \nAlsendo successfully embarked on a comprehensive \nESG transformation journey quickly achieving maturity \nin that respect. Looking at ESG-enabled revenues, \nthe following areas were included in the calculations. \nAccording to our methodology, \nwe calculated that ESG initiatives \nsupported approximately 23% \nof\u00a0the company\u2019s 2022 EBITDA.\nAbris\u2019 commitment to TCFD aligns with our dedication \nto transparency, accountability, and sustainability.

This flagship program promotes best-in-\nclass diversity, equity and inclusion management \npractices across our portfolio. \nThe DEI Code sets out six key commitments, covering \neducation and setting the tone, governance, owner-\nship and process, and culminating with a commitment \nfrom Abris to take on the role of DEI leadership, pro-\nmoting inclusion across the private equity ecosystem. \nThe Code also encompasses DEI recommendations \nthat advisors and other contractors should adhere to \nwhen working with Abris.\nThere is no one-size-fits-all DEI approach for portfolio \ncompanies, therefore, as in previous flagship pro-\ngrams, we designed it as a roadmap for achieving the \nbest results at each portfolio company. \nc) Describe the resilience of \nthe organization\u2019s strategy, \ntaking into consideration \ndifferent climate-related \nscenarios, including a 2\u00b0C or \nlower scenario.\na) Describe the organization\u2019s \nprocesses for identifying and \nassessing climate-related \nrisks.\nb) Describe the organization\u2019s \nprocesses for managing \nclimate-related risks.\nc) Describe how processes \nfor identifying, assessing, and \nmanaging climate-related \nrisks are integrated into the \norganization\u2019s overall risk \nmanagement.\na) Disclose the metrics used \nby the organization to assess \nclimate-related risks and \nopportunities in line with its \nstrategy and risk manage-\nment process\nb) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, \nand, if appropriate, Scope 3 \ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emis-\nsions, and the related risks\nRisk Management \u2013 recommended disclosure\nMetric and Targets \u2013 recommended disclosure\nThe six key commitments of the DEI Code: \n1.\t\nCreating a culture of \u201cDEI Readiness\u201d through education, \ninternal dialogue and the application of best market practices. \n2.\t Ensuring at least 30% of the underrepresented gender in the \ncomposition of supervisory boards and leadership of portfolio \ncompanies. \n3.\t Appointing the Chief People Officer (CPO) as a Management \nBoard member in each portfolio company to elevate HR and DEI \ntopics to the strategic level. \n4.\t Building formalised and transparent HR systems with industry \nrelevant DEI chapters in each portfolio company. \n5.\t Prioritising constant learning based on monitoring and reporting \nvia the ESG Scoring Application. \n6.\t Promoting DEI in the private equity ecosystem, taking leadership \non building DEI into relationships with advisors.\nEdgar Kolesnik \nPartner of\nAbris Capital Partners:\n\u201cI believe in diverse teams.  \nThis can be difficult to achieve at the \nbeginning, but the results can become \nmanagement tool. It can require you to \nstep outside of your comfort zone, but \nlong-term benefits are evident. In order to \nrepresent diversity at the strategic level  \nand create long-term value, companies \nmust appoint a Chief People Officer \ncharged with building and retaining the \ntalent pool. The CPO must be a part of the \nManagement Board, where she/he will \nact as an employee sponsor and change \nagent by anticipating HR-related needs.\u201d\n 26\n27\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nIn 2023 we delivered the first commitment of our DEI Code:  \nCreating a culture of \u201cDEI Readiness\u201d. \nTogether with the Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Alliance \nand external experts we prepared a series of educa-\ntional videos: Abris DEI Talks. \nThese interviews present and explain the significance \nof various DEI aspects in building an engaged organ-\nizational culture and serve as an inspiration for the \nleaders to dive deeper into DEI advantages. We have \nshared these insights with our portfolio companies, \nemployees and the wider ecosystem.\nDEI Talks comprised seven films. In each episode, an \nexpert explains a specific people management related \nissue along with a practical example of its occurrence \nwithin the organization. The issues we discussed \nincluded: neurodiversity, biases, talent acquisition, \nefficient onboarding, leadership communication and \nDEI as a response to a crisis.\n1. Unlimited growth \nEvery individual has unique strengths, weaknesses, \nand aspirations. Organizations need to adapt their de-\nvelopment paths to meet individuals\u2019 needs but most \nof all benefit from specific individual talents. When \nemployees feel valued, respected, and included into \ndecision making, they are more likely to be engaged, \nmotivated, and productive.\nOur portfolio companies learned how organizations \ncreate an environment where employees can grow \nand develop their skills.\n2. Benefits of neurodiversity\nNeurodiversity describes the idea that people expe-\nrience and interact with the world in many different \nways. There is no \u201cright\u201d way of thinking, learning, \nand behaving, and differences cannot be viewed as \ndeficits.\nNeurodiversity might present a challenge for leaders \nand organizations, especially in everyday business \npractices, but can also be a source of conflict in \norganizations, stemming from differences in com-\nmunication styles. On the other hand, neurodiverse \nemployees often can contribute exceptional skills \nand talents enriching the overall competencies and \nknowledge capacity.\nOur expert explains the intricacies of neurodiversity in \nthe context of new business models, work methods, \nand digital transformation. \n3. We are all biased\nOur portfolio companies can ask themselves what \nspecific actions can be implemented in their company \nto increase diversity in order to support better deci-\nsion-making.\nIt is important to begin by acknowledging that we are \nall biased. We are not neutral. Each of us has our own \nexperiences and cultural backgrounds. Therefore, \nthere is no place where we can exist without biases. \nOur expert introduces the \u201csecond thought rule\u201d, which \nstates that by admitting that we all have biases, we \ncan give ourselves the time and the opportunity to \nmake a second evaluation that will be more objective.\n4. We need talents\nThe importance of DEI in talent acquisition is critical, \nand not merely from a compliance perspective. It is a \nstrategic imperative that positively impacts organi-\nzational performance, innovation capacity, employee \nengagement, and overall success in an increasingly \ndemanding and competitive business environment.\n5. Making onboarding efficient and building for \nthe future\nOnboarding is a magic moment when new employees \ndecide to stay engaged or become disengaged. An \ninclusive onboarding process contributes to a positive \nworkplace culture, increased employee satisfaction, \nand improved business outcomes. It is an investment \nin the long-term success an organization through \nleveraging the unique strengths and perspectives of a \ndiverse workforce. \n6. Communication is king, and queen\nAn inclusive communication embraces diversity, \nrespects individuals\u2019 differences, and ensures that \neveryone feels heard and valued. Open dialogue and \nactive listening are essential components of identify-\ning inclusive communication needs.\nGuiding principles for inclusive communication in busi-\nness includes: Respect and dignity; Clarity and simplic-\nity; Accessibility; Inclusive language; Active listening; \nEducation and training.\n7. Crisis is an opportunity\nDEI enables better responses to crises, but only if it is \nan integral part of the organizational culture. \nLeaders play a vital role in transforming a DEI crisis into \na learning process. It is essential for leaders to demon-\nstrate inclusive behaviors and champion diversity at \nall levels of the organization. By promoting transparen-\ncy, open communication, and accountability, leaders \ncan create a safe space for employees to voice their \nconcerns and ideas. Moreover, leaders should lead \nby example and actively seek feedback from their \nteams to ensure that the organization\u2019s DEI initiatives \nare aligned with the needs and aspirations of all their \nstakeholders. Individuals, leaders, teams, and whole or-\nganizations are compelled to find innovative solutions.\n\u201cWe are committed to ensuring that the proportion of women \non the Board of Directors and Supervisory Board is no less \nthan 30%. We are proud that at the present moment, the \nlevel in both bodies is 50%. In addition, it is important for us to \nmaintain a minimum 40% share of women in management \npositions. In the recruitment process, we pay special attention \nto the diversity of our team formation. We believe that this is \nthe only way we can create a unique working environment, be \na competitive employer and achieve above-average results.\u201d \nMonika Bieszk \nDirector of Human Resources and Sustainability, \nBoard Member, DOT2DOT SA \n 28\n29\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nResponsible Investment \nManagement System\nAbris\u2019 Responsible Investment Policy defines respon-\nsibilities, presents our investment process path, and \nsets out the rules of transparency.

Our \ncriteria are based on the overarching principles of \nrespecting human rights and protecting the envi-\nronment. This means we do not invest in companies \ninvolved in areas such as: activities that contravene \nUN or EU conventions on fundamental rights such as \nchild labour, racial discrimination, trade embargoes \nor environmental protection; the production or trade \nof alcohol; the production or trade of tobacco; drift \nnet fishing using nets in excess of 2.5km in length; and \nmaterial / systemic corruption.\nLink: https://abris-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Abris- \nCapital-Partners_Exclusion-list.06.2022.pdf\n 32\n33\nESG Report 2023     Abris as a responsible investor\nAbris Capital Partners\nDue diligence\nBefore proceeding with due diligence, ESG catego-\nrization is carried out according to Abris\u2019 proprietary \nmethodology. The objective is to conduct a prelim-\ninary assessment of the company\u2019s key ESG risks, \nallowing us to decide the scope and focus of our ESG \ndue diligence and to select the most appropriate \nexternal due diligence providers. For the purposes of \ncategorization, the following data is collected: number \nof employees, human rights risks in the supply chain, \nand water and energy use. ESG due diligence is an \nintegral and mandatory element of Abris\u2019 investment \nprocesses.\nExit\nAt the start of each investment, Abris sets long-term \nobjectives in the form of an ESG Exit Path Model, as well \nas annual objectives. The Exit Path Model contains the \nESG goals that company should achieve by the time \nAbris exits its investment. Together with each portfolio \ncompany, we strive to achieve the best result \u2013 a \nscore of 100% implementation (see charts). The Exit \nPath Model is monitored throughout the investment \nlifecycle through action plans, KPIs, and reporting, \nand its status is updated by the Abris ESG Team every \nquarter and reviewed by the Investment Team  in the \nESG Scoring Application.\nTypical annual action-plan supported by \nthe\u00a0ESG Scoring Application\nDuring first quarter of each year, the ESG Team \nconducts its annual ESG analysis with each portfolio \ncompany. The analysis is based on site visits and \ninterviews with ESG Coordinators, CEOs, CFOs and \nemployees responsible for specific ESG topics within \neach portfolio company. During these visits, we use the \nScoring Application. Once complete, the company\u2019s \nrisk map is automatically updated, allowing us to iden-\ntify the most significant risks and the key ESG areas \nthat need to be addressed. After the ESG analysis, the \nESG Team \u2013 in cooperation with the Deal Team and \nmanagement board of the portfolio company \u2013 create \nan ESG Action Plan for the year. These plans are added \nto the Scoring Application and can be updated once \na quarter by the portfolio company\u2019s ESG Coordinator, \nas well as being reviewed during quarterly calls. ESG \ngoals are part of the annual KPIs for senior executives.\nThis methodology applies to 100% of our investment. \nMonitoring and value creation\nAbris ESG Scoring Application \nIn 2020, Abris launched its proprietary ESG Scoring Ap-\nplication software, which tracks more than 600 metrics \nat each portfolio company and allows us to measure \nand analyze ESG actions across our portfolio.

Whatever we do \nand whichever challenge, objective or task we decide to undertake, we carry \nfull responsibility for the results, protecting stakeholders\u2019 interests and super-\nvising the possible impact our actions may have. We will always go the extra \nmile, to make sure that the commitments or promises we make are accom-\nplished and that our deeds generate as much value as possible for the famous \n\u201c3P (People, Planet, Profit)\u201d. \nThe Responsible Investing concept has always been at the heart of our busi-\nness philosophy. We remain committed to strengthening the attention of the \nentire team on principles of Responsible Investing. We also consistently urge \nour portfolio companies to align their actions and strategies with our approach. \nOur ESG integration methodology, as discussed in Abris ESG 2020 Universe, \nis a complete program presenting our ambitions and setting very pragmatic \nand practical goals. Therefore, our choice of priorities for each year is driven \nprimarily by a desire to improve value creation, but also by our fundamentally \nrisk-based approach. In 2018, following both EU trends and regulatory focus, \nwe have concentrated on a broad implementation of our \u201czero tolerance\u201d \npolicy by implementing codes of ethical conduct, anti-corruption procedures \nand professional whistleblowing tools. We are happy with the results that \nyou will see presented in this report, but especially with the level of support \nreceived from the Abris team and our investee companies. Our commitment \nto make a real change is rock-solid. \nIn 2019, we will continue doing our utmost to professionalize through institut-\ning new projects within the governance area. I hope to present some interest-\ning achievements in our next year\u2019s report, but I also hope to share some of our \nbest practices with the PE community in Central and Eastern Europe.\nThis will go hand-in-hand with several initiatives launched by governmental \nauthorities in the CEE region, which is on track to deliver not only outstanding \neconomic growth, but also major changes in corporate governance and the \nprofessional standards of doing business. I am sure it will be another interesting \nESG year for all of us here!\nI would like to sincerely thank our Abris team for their hard work on integrat-\ning ESG in their daily schedules and our portfolio managers for their buy-in to \nthe idea. Special gratitude goes also to our limited partners for your support \nand feedback.

Therefore, Abris \nis a signatory of the Principles for Responsible \nInvestment (\u201cPRI\u201d) and has used it\u2019s Six Principles \nas a framework for developing ESG policy across \nall of our investment activities. Since December \n2018, Abris has also been committed to the UN \nGlobal Compact corporate responsibility initia-\ntive and its principles in the areas of human rights, \nlabor, environment and anti-corruption. Our ESG \nteam members are regularly contributing to the \nprojects and initiatives of both organizations, \nwinning broad recognition throughout the com-\nmunity.\nAbris stands as a link between global investors \nand regional companies. Both the Six Principles of \nthe PRI and the Ten Principles of the UN Global \nCompact inspire us to transform ideas of sustain-\nable development and responsible investment \ninto practice. \nWe support the United Nations Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals. In 2015, all United Nations \nMember States committed to 17 Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) to help us all end \nextreme poverty, fight inequality & injustice, and \nfind solutions to climate change. We have a role to \nplay in achieving these goals for a more pros-\nperous, equitable, and sustainable world. Abris \nstrives to contribute to the SDGs through its own \nactivities and those of the portfolio companies. \nTherefore, selected activities of portfolio com-\npanies will be further presented in the context of \nachieving these goals.\nOur responsibility and impact\nAbris, as an institutional investor, has a duty to act in the \nbest long-term interests of its beneficiaries. \nIn this fiduciary role, we believe that environmen-\ntal, social, and corporate governance initiatives \ncan beneficially affect the performance of invest-\nment portfolios and mitigate various risks. As a so-\ncially responsible investor, we invest in companies \nthat act responsibly in terms of ESG; therefore, \nour decision-making process includes several \nmilestones related to ESG risk evaluation. \nWe are aware of our economic, social and \nenvironmental impact, especially through the \noperations of our portfolio companies. Our ESG \napproach supports the circular economy goals of \ngradually reducing consumption of finite resourc-\nes and eliminating systems waste while transition-\ning to renewable energy sources. This represents \na systemic shift that builds long-term resilience, \ngenerates business and economic opportunities, \nand provides environmental and societal benefits. \nWe work to build economic and social value in \nour investments through close collaboration and \ngenuine respect for our business partners.\nWe believe good and effective corporate gov-\nernance, with a professional ESG approach is a \nprerequisite to building strong companies and, \nultimately, maximizing shareholder value. We \nactively engage with our portfolio companies \nthroughout the investment process and insist \non embedding ESG issues in all steps along the \nway. The businesses in which we invest must be \ncognizant of the social impact and environmental \nconsequences arising from their operations.\n20%\nThe scale of our impact is reflected in the following results:\naverage EBITDA CAGR \nover the last 5 years\nof total portfolio sales\n\u20ac1.5bn\nemployees in our  \nportfolio companies\nnew jobs created in our \nportfolio companies \nunder our stewardship\n\u20ac1.2bn\nof committed capital\nMore than\n12,500\n1,700+\n Abris as a responsible investor \nABRIS CAPITAL PARTNERS\n17\nAbris as a responsible investor \nESG REPORT 2018\n16\nESG End to End Investment Process\nWe have incorporated our Responsible Invest-\nment Policy and our ESG Monitoring Procedure \nfully into our investment process. From initial due \ndiligence to Investment Committee approvals, to \npost-investment monitoring, ESG considerations \nare evaluated throughout the process as we work \nclosely with our portfolio companies in develop-\ning their ESG policies and procedures. Once an \ninvestment is made, we continue monitoring ESG \nrisks to ensure the interests of our limited partners \nare well protected.\nPre-acquisition stage\nESG standards are formally incorporated into \nour investment due diligence process. The Deal \nLeaders are responsible for reviewing all potential \ninvestment targets from a corporate responsibility \nperspective in order to understand the profile and \npotential ESG risks of each company. \nEvery potential portfolio company is checked \nagainst the Abris Exclusion List, based on all \ncontractual terms included in our LPAs. Abris will \nnever invest in companies on the Exclusion List. \nDuring analysis of a target company, Investment \nTeams are assisted by ESG colleagues in deter-\nmining the scope of ESG due diligence to be \nperformed. It is based on Categorization Guide-\nlines developed by Abris, to ascertain the relevant \ncomplexity of ESG Due Diligence.\nFollowing the ESG Due Diligence, ESG advisors \nsubmit reports to the Investment and ESG Teams \nfor further discussion. In the event that material \nenvironmental issues are revealed in a red flag re-\nport, the Investment Committee is then notified. \nIf the Deal is approaching the ultimate investment \nstage, a final report is provided and reviewed. A \nDeal Qualifying Memorandum with an ESG action \nplan is presented to the Investment Committee. \nThe plan is further developed into one section of \nthe post-investment 100-day plan.\nESG 2020 Universe - The path we are on\nIn 2017, the Abris management team made a \nclear commitment to strengthen our responsible \ninvesting policies and to develop Abris ESG 2020 \nUniverse.

Abris\u2019 ESG \nTeam works closely with both ESG Coordinators \nand their teams.\nIn order to assure comprehensive analysis and \nevaluation of ESG integration in portfolio compa-\nnies, we have built a proprietary ESG Scoring tool \nand evaluation methodology.\nESG Scoring allows us to measure risk, manage-\nment practices and indicators in ten areas: corpo-\nrate governance, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, \nhuman resources, health & safety, human rights, \nenvironment, sanction & anti-trust, IT & cyber se-\ncurity, product/service safety, and marketing. The \nAbris ESG Scoring utilizes more than 350 meas-\nures to help us conduct in-depth ESG analyses.\nThe Abris ESG Scoring tool is used to identify ESG \nrisks and measure implementation progress on an \nannual basis.

The Company considers \nGDPR to be extremely important in a number of ways. Firstly, the \nregulations on protection of personal data affect practically every \nlevel of our business activity. Ensuring the security of personal \ndata for the Company\u2019s customers and employees will enable us \nto avoid the risk of incurring high financial penalties. The Com-\npany approached this task comprehensively. In June and July \n2018, an audit was carried out by an external party. Based on the \ncollected data, our existing security features and the recommen-\ndations derived from the audit report, we created a security policy \nfor personal data processing. Prior to and during the preparation \nfof the finalized security policy, the Company undertook early \nactions to ensure appropriate data security. Following GDPR \nemployee training, in October the Management Board adopted \nthe new security policy. Shortly thereafter, all employees received \ngeneral information on the changes and the range of responsibili-\nties, recommendations and documents needed.\nDue to the specific nature of the GDPR, the Company continually \nundertakes activities to ensure a high level of data protection.\nCASE STUDY\nGOAL 16\nESG activities  \nin 2018\nAs President of Industrial Division , I consider ESG to be a necessary \nand helpful tool. It allows us to judge the company from non-finan-\ncial point of view.

The selec-\ntion process continued the \nCompany\u2019s strategy from \nprevious years to prioritize \nthe support for youth from \nLower Silesia. The Com-\npany has signed agree-\nments with these entities \nto establish the terms of \nsponsorship.\n \nIndustrial Division, owner of the Cargounit brand, has been op-\nerating on the market since 2003. The Company\u2019s activity is the \nacquisition, rental and maintenance of rolling stock. The Company \nwas established on the basis of Polish capital. It is one of the largest \nROSCO companies operating in Europe and one of the few Polish \nentities offering a rolling stock lease operating independently of \nthe vehicle manufacturer. Cargounit specialize in the petrochemi-\ncal industry as well as in transport of raw materials and specializes \ncargo. The Company owns also Powerunit brand. Cargounit applies \nto freight transport vehicles while Powerunit refers to vehicles used \nfor passenger transport.\nCARGOUNIT\nFleet management policy\nThe Fleet management \npolicy was finalized in 2018 \nand the final draft has been \nagreed with the legal and \nfinancial department.

This is to prevent \nany possible conflict of \ninterest or corruption. That \nis why we have introduced a \nwhistleblowing mechanism \nand monitoring of proce-\ndures along with it.\nEnvironmental \nimprovements\nAs a production facility, the \nenvironmental standards are \nvery important for us. We \nstrive hard to optimize pro-\nduction processes so as not \nto contribute to environmen-\ntal pollution. For example, \nwe limit consumption of \nelectricity in the produc-\ntion hall by using LED bulbs \nand eliminate the alcohol \nused during production with \nbuffers that reduce alcohol \nconsumption by 50%. What\u2019s \nmore, we are gradually work-\ning on optimizing each pro-\nduction process individually \nso we can optimize each of \nour packaging processes. We \nalso take care when sourcing \nour paper by only purchasing \nproduct with PEFC and FSC \ncertificates.\nCASE STUDY\nFor us at Dot2Dot group, sustainable development and social \nresponsibility are a strategic issue. We consider our actions in these \nareas as part of our competitive advantage. Dot2Dot does not rely \nsolely on traditional financial statements. Non-financial issues are \nalso an extremely important factor in our decision-making. We \nstrive to build our values in a sustainable, but also long-lasting, way. \nThat is why managing our company\u2019s development and corporate \ngovernance is so important to us. We are proud of the values and \nstandards by which we operate.\u201d\nKrzysztof Ros\u0142aniec \nCEO Dot2Dot\nSupport and supplementary programs for our employees are \nimportant to us. We are proud of the Dot4Development project, \nconsisting of three pillars: Leadership, Basic and Talent Manager. \nIn the second half of the year we also introduced work-life-bal-\nance training. Another program we are developing is the Ambition \nPlan, which is directly connected to the bonus program.\nAs the proverb says, \u201cSecurity is not everything, but without se-\ncurity everything is nothing.\u201d One of the top priorities of Dot2Dot \nmanagement is building a safety culture. Shaping the culture \nitself is a dynamic process, because changing habits, beliefs or \nbehaviors is often a challenge. It requires time and a professional \napproach. Therefore, at the beginning of the year, SEKA S.A. took \nover the coordination of health and safety processes as well as fire \nprotection and obligatory employee training in that area.\nIt is important for us to support young, ambitious people. That is \nwhy we are launching the Practical Apprenticeship program. It en-\ntails cooperation with a technical school in Tarn\u00f3w Podg\u00f3rne, near \nBator\u00f3w. Under expert supervision, students will acquire practical \nknowledge about our profession. We are proud that we can share \nour knowledge with young people.\nAttractive employer\nDot2Dot is a leader in the printing industry in Poland, employing \nnearly 700 people in four locations. Our clients can take advantage \nof a one-stop-shop for a wide range of packaging options and inno-\nvative design solutions, including our top quality multi-color print-\ning, luxury packaging expertise, unique packaging constructions, \nembossing & lamination and 3-D effects.

The project idea \narose from meetings with \nemployees regarding prob-\nlems encountered in the \nworkplace and discussions \non finding solutions. The \nformer system employed \noperators handling around \n680 -1120 kg per shift using \ntwo employees and forklift. \nThe new system enables \nworkers to more easily \nhandle heavy weights, as \nthe effort is transferred \nto an automated system, \nrequiring only one opera-\ntor, that retrieves the big \nroles and places them onto \npallets. The reduction in \nphysical effort also greatly \ndecreases the risks of ac-\ncidental injury.\nH&S project upgrading \nthe thermosetting oven \nto decrease or eliminate \nfire risk\nFollowing the fire in our \nfiber section oven in 2017 \n(from the self-ignition of \nmaterials), we changed the \noven and installed a steam \ninstallation to limit or extin-\nguish a fire inside the oven. \nAlso, we added an alert sys-\ntem consisting of 10 lamps, \nan acoustic warning and 8 \nfire alerting buttons to send \nan alarm to staff in case of \nan oven fire.

Historically, water consumption fluctu-\nated between 2.9 and 2.2 liters per can. Management set a goal of \nreducing water consumption to 1 liter per can.\nOne of our first steps was to set up a team to analyse all available \ndata. This prompted a management decision to increase the num-\nber of measurement points for water consumption, measure these \npoints manually and save the measurement data to a searchable \narchive. New tools from the Lean management group were used \nfor the project data analysis.\nAfter identifying the largest points of consumption, we conducted \na second round of analysis to ascertain the most effective solu-\ntions for reducing water consumption. Several machines were \nselected to be either upgraded or replaced. The plant\u2019s middle \nmanagement received training on reducing water consumption \nand a portion of the maintenance team\u2019s cleaning and disinfection \ntools were replaced. \nWithin five months of initiating the project, we reached our goal of \nonly 1.2 liters per can. The year ended with an average of 1.07 liters \nper can. During this time, we saved approximately PLN 1.9m of \nbudgeted costs for the water and wastewater segment.

As a \nsuccessful business, we \nheavily rely on our manage-\nment team and employ-\nees. The formal Code of \nConduct, as well as the \nanti-corruption policy, will \nbe a helpful guide in our \neveryday business endeav-\nors. There are many situa-\ntions that may raise ethical \nconcerns. We want to study \nvarious business situations \nto help us in distinguishing \nbetween actions or behav-\niors that fall within accept-\nable business standards \nand those that go beyond \nthese standards. This is also \nimportant within the con-\ntext of upcoming changes \nto legal regulations found \nin the Act on the Liabilities \nof Collective Entities.\nWe find that comprehen-\nsive employee trainings \nin preparing necessary \ndocuments and standards \nare a very important part of \nthis process. To effectively \ncounteract undesirable \nbehaviors or situations, we \nneed ensure that everyone \nat Velvet Care understands \nthe kind of activities that \nare deemed unacceptable. \nThese efforts naturally re-\nquire that appointment of \na Compliance Officer and \na Compliance Committee, \nas well as, the implementa-\ntion of the whistleblow-\ning procedure. We are \nconvinced that eliminating \nundesirable behaviors is a \ncritical element in building \nan organizational culture \nbased on universal and \nshared values. This step is \nnecessary for us to grow \nas an organization and to \nfurther extend the scope of \nour business activities.\nWe see it as the main priority of our business. That is why we are \nalready taking major steps in the first year of our cooperation with \nAbris. We perceive ESG as an important tool for building the Com-\npany\u2019s value and as an integral part of the long-term \u201cVelvet CARE \n2023\u201d strategy. To a large extent, these standards have already \nbeen in existence in Velvet Care for a long time. A comprehensive, \nproprietary project approach provides us with a great opportunity \nto systematize ESG activities and supplement quickly any deficits \nin this area. Our priorities in 2019 are to implement code of ethical \nconduct and an anti-corruption policy, together with appointing a \nCompliance Officer and Compliance Committee. We will also be \nimplementing a new whistleblowing procedure.\u201d\nArtur Pielak\nCEO Velvet CARE\nIn 2018, Velvet CARE initiated and successfully completed the \nproject to reduce gas emissions to the atmosphere. Our responsi-\nbilities concerning this aspect of our business led us to shut down \nthe coal-fired boiler linked with the MP6 paper machine and \ndiscontinue using external energy sources, opting to install both a \ngas-fired boiler and our own steam energy sources. \nWith these changes we have significantly reduced the emission of \ngases and air polluters such as SO , NOx, Co2, PM10 and PM2,5 into \nthe atmosphere. The effects are very encouraging. SO2 emissions \nhave been reduced by 98% and CO2 emissions by 42%. The gas \nboiler room has significantly decreased annual atmospheric emis-\nsions by 38 tones in case of SO2, by 32 tones of NOx and by 7,350 \ntones of CO2. These numbers are related to the manufacturing of \ncellulose tissue at the MP6 paper machine, operating since 1976. \nThe gas-fired boiler project for the MP6 paper machine was com-\npleted in 2018. The new boiler house was built nearby to eliminate \nlosses from energy transfer. To sum up, switching to modern tech-\nnology has allowed to reduce gas & air pollution emission and re-\nduce heat loss while simultaneously benefiting from energy costs \nsavings. In general, the Company\u2019s thermal energy consumption \ndeclined by 18% within the first year!\nAs a leading cellulose tissue manufacturer in the CEE region, \nVelvet CARE is enthusiastic about implementing environmentally \nfriendly solutions. We are proud of meeting the EU Ecolabel crite-\nria and maintaining the EU Ecolabel certificate.\nGas-fired boiler and own \nsteam energy sources\nVelvet CARE is a leading manufacturer of cellulose hygiene goods \nincluding tissues, toilet rolls, kitchen rolls. The paper factory, located \nin Klucze in the south of Poland, has been in operation since 1897. \n\u201cVelvet\u201d is an iconic brand, positioned as the undisputable branded \nmarket leader in Poland. Velvet CARE is also an important supplier \nof Private Label products for the entire CEE and DACH regions. \nFrom 2013 to 2018, the Company implemented 3 strategic projects \nvalued at PLN 250m, including the installation of 6 new production \nlines, the construction of a new warehouse and, most importantly, \none of the most technically advanced paper machine available. \nThereby doubling manufacturing capacity to the level of 100,000 \ntons of cellulose tissue annually. The Company has doubled its \nturnover and added around 300 new employees during past three \nyears.\nVelvet CARE\nESG activities  \nin 2018\nFUND III\n 51\n50\nAbout the company\nPortfolio overview\nPortfolio overview\nGOAL 8\n\u201c\nGDPR\nWDX S.A. established a \nspecialist position to man-\nage GDPR, with continual \nsupport by an outside law \nfirm. The Company has a \npersonal data protection \npolicy in place and all em-\nployees are obliged to un-\ndergo training in this area. \nPersonal data processing \nagreements are signed with \nall our contractors and kept \nfully up-to-date. Each new \nproject undergoes compli-\nance consultations with the \nGDPR specialist.\nCASE STUDY\nFor many years now, when developing our strategies, we have been \nfocusing on maximizing the profits of the Company and its share-\nholder value. But we also focus on environmental protection, social \ninterests and relations with other stakeholder groups. Today, our \nlong-term strategy is to emphasize two main areas:\n\u203a\tFurther improving corporate governance, business ethics and \nworking conditions, as well as opportunities for our employees, \nour most valuable asset, to develop their skills. \n\u203a\tEnvironmental protection through the introduction of standards \nand modern technologies which allow us to reduce pollutant \nemissions and decrease generated waste and to provide proper \nrecycling methodologies.\nOne of our most important tools, in conjunction with the afore-\nmentioned projects, is the implementation of an integrated quality \nmanagement system, including the following standards: ISO 14001 \nenvironmental management system, ISO 9001 quality management \nsystem, OHSAS 18001 occupational health and safety management \nsystem.\u201d\nDariusz B\u0105kowski \nCEO WDX S.A.\nOccupational safety is an important area of operations for any \nenterprise. We set out twenty-three goals for 2018. Eigtheen tasks \nwere completed In total and 4 projects remain in various stages \nof implementation (15% to 75% completed). First aid training was \none of our completed projects. More than 60 people received \ntraining during this course. The training put a strong emphasis on \nthe practical application of first aid techniques, thereby preparing \ntrainees to take the correct measures in the event of an accident. \nWe have since seen their new skills reflected in the workplace ac-\ncident severity rate, which fell 35% from 49 in 2017 to 32 in 2018.\nAnother project that improved both worker safety and fire protec-\ntion was the removal of the explosion hazard zone from the paint \nshop. In this project, the existing paint and lacquer warehouse \nlocated next to the spray booth was permanently closed. In its \nplace, the main chemical warehouse was created. Thanks to a new \nefficient ventilation system, the explosion hazard zone has been \ncompletely eliminated.\nThe old spray gun washing station was replaced by an explosion-\nproof automatic washing station, significantly improving fire \nsafety during washing and eliminating employees\u2019 exposure to \nchemicals. The aforementioned activities by the Company have \ngreatly contributed to increased workplace safety and a reduced \nfire hazard.\nImproving worker \nsafety\nWDX S.A. manufactures and supplies integrated solutions for \nwarehouse equipment & storage and designs logistics systems for \ninternal transport. The Company has an in-house design office, \nR&D department and a modern handling system manufacturing \nplant. The plant has an area of 20,503m2 and a production capacity \nof 30,000 tons of steel per year, fabricating innovative conveyors \nand warehouse racks. Additionally, the Company distributes and \nprovides maintenance services for Crown, Doosan and Combilift \nforklift trucks. \nWDX S.A. brings many years\u2019 experience, coupled with an enormous \nproduction capacity, to the implementation of comprehensive \nsystem solutions and the creation of modern and fully automated \nwarehouses.

The \nproject is being imple-\nmented in cooperation with \nthe Silesian University of \nTechnology.\nAnti-corruption and \nwhistleblowing program\nWDX S.A. places a strong \nemphasis on legal compli-\nance in all of its business \noperations. To minimize \nthe risk of a breach, the \nManagement Board ap-\npointed a Compliance Of-\nficer whose role is to ensure \ncompliance with the Com-\npany\u2019s internal regulations \nand to manage the risk \nof non-compliance.

Even if it often stayed open late, this door would create a separation between \nthe two worlds, allowing us to clear our minds and focus on work while in the office \nand on rest, relaxation and family time when at home. \nCovid-19 and compulsory lockdowns suddenly made this door disappear, and the \ntwo worlds collided. Many things changed. Our desks suddenly landed in our kitch-\nens and living rooms, and we found ourselves answering emails 24/7, our screens al-\nways on and our mobile phones glued to our palms. We got used to working through \na small window, endlessly repeating \u201cyou are on mute\u201d, and we were unexpectedly \nintroduced to our colleagues\u2019 pets and kids. Meanwhile our suits and ties gathered \ndust in our wardrobes. \nWhile many people coped with the changes, lockdown had a troubling impact on \nmental health, with a marked increase in the rates of depression and suicide. In \naddition, thousands of jobs were lost, with knock-on effects on personal wealth, \nconsumer behavior and retail performance. These changes affected the business \nenvironment we operate in and imposed an entirely new approach to leadership, \nmanagement and everyday human relations. Therefore, if I were to pick one word to \ndescribe what was critical for us last year, it would be AGILITY.\nOur ESG focus in 2020 shifted strongly towards the social and crisis management \naspects. Together with our portfolio management teams, we designed and imple-\nmented sophisticated health protection procedures for all employees, polished and \ndeveloped our existing Business Continuity Plans, and trained portfolio companies in \ncrisis communication. I was genuinely amazed by the hundreds of hours our teams \nspent supporting CEOs and portfolio company leadership, defending their busi-\nnesses in what were extremely challenging conditions. Today, I can firmly say that \nwe understand the dynamics of market crises much better, and our toolkits to fight \ntheir consequences are now far more comprehensive. And most importantly, all our \nportfolio companies survived, maintained healthy cashflows and keep growing.\nI am also proud to announce that we have just launched a new ESG strategy for \nAbris \u2013 ESG Universe 2023. It is a continuation and development of our 2020 Universe \nproject, during which we found that our assumptions and approach were proved \ncorrect. We have learned an enormous amount from our work along the way, and \nwe used this expertise to add new projects and go further than ever before. \nESG Universe 2023 provides a comprehensive, overarching structure for all our work \nin this area. It encompasses 17 separate, but linked, projects across four key catego-\nries: governance and culture, standards; education; and carbon neutrality.\nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nSince carbon footprint reduction is the most \ncritical mission for all management teams \nworldwide, we want Abris to be a frontrunner \nfor private equity in the Central Europe region. \nAlong with our long-term commitment to \nexecute SDG 13 (Climate Action), our ambition \nis to deliver a net-zero carbon balancing \nmodel for the portfolio by 2025 \u2013 becoming the \nfirst private equity firm in the region to commit \nto carbon neutrality. \nIn 2017, when we launched our ESG Universe \n2020, we planted the tree. Today, we are ready \nto grow the forest. \nIn addition to their work in ESG, I am also glad to report that our Value Enhance-\nment Team has been kept very busy in 2020. Szymon and Tomasz, who joined Abris \nrecently, are devoting a lot of their time to building the value of our investments by \nimplementing an efficient internal controls framework, strengthening cybersecurity \nand by boosting digitalization across our portfolio. \nI hope readers will appreciate the 2020 edition of our ESG report and the work \nwe have done during the year, never giving up on our strategy\u2019s key principles of \ninvesting responsibly and efficiently, despite the challenging circumstances. I want \nto express my warm thanks to the entire Abris team and our best-in-class manage-\nment teams for their exceptional work and true commitment throughout the year, \nas well as to our investors, without whom none of this would be possible.

Now, we are building upon this expand-\ned expertise to analyze, adapt, add new projects and \ntake our ESG work further and deeper than ever before.\nESG Universe 2023 utilizes a three pillars approach to \nestablish a sustainable, proprietary program encom-\npassing 17 new initiatives within four key categories: \nGovernance and Culture, Standards, Education and \nCarbon Neutrality. \nThe strategy embodies the clear purpose of supporting \nrisk mitigation and value creation across the Abris \nportfolio, achieving a carbon neutral portfolio by \n2025 and establishing net-zero action plans for each \nindividual portfolio company.  \n Abris Capital Partners\n21\n20\nESG Report 2020  |  Abris as a responsible investor\nSince carbon footprint re-\nduction is the most important \nmission for all management \nteams across the world, \nwe want Abris to be a front \nrunner in this area for private \nequity in the Central Europe \nregion. Our ambition is to \ndeliver a net-zero carbon bal-\nancing model for the portfolio \nby 2025.\nOver the coming years, \nclimate change will strongly \nimpact every operating \nmodel and every industry \nacross the world. Our objec-\ntive is to make sure all our \nportfolio companies adapt \nto this reality in a sustainable \nway and actively participate \nin reducing carbon emissions \naccording to the EU Green \nDeal framework. The 2030 \ntarget will be embedded in \nour portfolio actions.\nWe will promote carbon \nneutrality in the investment \nindustry by participating in \ninitiatives with stakeholders, \npublishing guides and sharing \nbest practices.\nThe Abris commitment to a \ncarbon neutral portfolio by 2025\nNew focus of the ESG Universe\nOur ability to mitigate climate challenges effectively \nplays an important role in our investment approach. \nWe are committed to successfully transitioning to a \nlow-carbon economy and providing long-term stability \nfor our portfolio companies. Abris measures ESG risk \njust as thoroughly as we analyze traditional market \nmetrics. Our ESG approach is comprised of three focus \nareas to outline our direction and our aims.\nOversight\nWe have designed an impressive \narray of tools and metrics to ana-\nlyze our environmental impact and \nbuild resilient strategies to reduce it \ngoing forward.\nResources\nWe are steadily transitioning \ntoward a comprehensive selection \nof off-set and reduction initiatives \nincluding recyclable materials in \npackaging, reducing landfill waste, \nstreamlining supply chain logistics \nand stewarding water resources.\nClimate change\nWe have heavily invested in climate \nchange-related topics influencing \nthe value of our investments since \n2019. In 2020, we embarked upon \na new goal to become carbon \nneutral by 2025. \nThe portfolio companies conduct risk analysis at the \nmanagement and operational levels. Each company \nreports visible risks and assesses their importance. \nAfter estimating the impact and probability of these \nrisks, appropriate corrective actions are agreed by \nAbris and the company. The list of risks is reviewed and \nupdated annually.\nA quarter of global emissions are now under car-\nbon-pricing schemes and the number is rising. We \nare completing climate resilience and CO2 reduction \nstrategies for each portfolio company by the end of \n2021. In our Risk and Opportunities Assessment Tool, \neach risk has an assigned impact on EBITDA. Thanks to \nthis, we can determine the extent of the costs of risk \nmanagement and include it in our financial planning.\nOur ESG efforts align with the EU Taxonomy on sus-\ntainable activities \u2013 a guide to transparent climate \ndisclosures from the financial sector. It helps investors \nunderstand which activities are environmentally \nsustainable and how to best navigate the transition to \na low-carbon economy. \nThe Taxonomy Regulation sets out the legal obligations \nfor financial market participants regarding the disclo-\nsure of sustainability risks and impacts. But failure to \nmeet the taxonomy obligations has wider implications. \nIf a company does not meet disclosure obligations, \nit may not be considered \u201cinvestable.\u201d At that point, \na range of obstacles could result, e.g., higher cost of \ncapital, a reduced valuation or a problematic sale \nscenario.\nWe designed the Abris Climate Change Strategy to \nfulfill all EU regulatory requirements. With the help of our \nESG Exit Scenario Model, our portfolio companies will \nmeet all obligations and regulations by the end of 2021. \nOur practical approach is based on precisely meas-\nuring the carbon footprint of all companies in the \nportfolio, followed by emissions reduction action plans \nand a catalog of validated offset initiatives, enabling \nthe portfolio to reach neutrality in 2025. To ensure the \nprogram is fundamentally focused on real reductions \nrather than offsets, over the course of each year Abris \nwill invest in further emission-reduction projects, \nmeaning each individual company will reach net-zero \nwithin the EU timeframe.\nAbris has tasked each of its portfolio companies not \nonly with reducing emissions, but also with adapting \ntheir strategies and operating models to climate \nchange, which, for some businesses, may have dest-\nabilizing effects. Therefore, it is critical to run in-depth \nanalysis and adaptation programs for each one.\nOur ambitious climate neutral goal is based on our \nprior accomplishments: \n\u2022\tPrepared a carbon footprint calculation tool in Scope \n1 and 2 \n\u2022\tPrepared an analysis tool for climate change-related \nrisks and opportunities based on the Task Force on \nClimate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD)\n\u2022\tTrained portfolio companies on carbon footprint and \nclimate-related risk and opportunities\n\u2022\tMeasured the carbon footprint in all our portfolio \ncompanies in 2020\n\u2022\tOur portfolio companies began work on emissions \nreduction plans and climate change actions relevant \nto their strategies and operations.\nCarbon \nneutrality\nEducation\nWe plan to build an extensive \nESG knowledge base for the \nAbris team and invest more in \ntheir education.\nOur portfolio teams have \nproven their strong com-\nmitment to excel in building \nregional industry champions. \nIn order to support them \nwhile facilitating access to \nknowledge sharing, we want \nto invest in better tools and \noffer open access to our ESG \nknow-how.\nWe strongly believe in the \npower of responsibility. \nTherefore, everything we do \naims to improve the quality \nand value of our ESG impact. \nThese activities will be openly, \ntransparently shared with our \nstakeholders. We will seek new \nopportunities for sharing our \nknowledge and experience \nwith a broader audience, \npro-actively promoting ESG \nstandards. We also hope to \nopen our ESG Academy to \nother regional PE players.\n\u201cCarbon Pricing Dashboard,\u201d The World Bank, 27 March, 2021, \nhttps://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/\n Abris Capital Partners\n23\nOur ESG pillars are \nguiding principles \nfor the Universe \n2023\nThe world emits around 50 billion tonnes of greenhouse \ngases each year. Greenhouse gas emissions mostly \ncome from the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, \nand natural gas, to produce electricity (25 percent of 2019 \ngreenhouse gas emissions), as well as from chemical, \nmetallurgical, and mineral transformation processes \n(23\u00a0percent of 2019 greenhouse gas emissions).\n Abris Capital Partners\n25\n24\nESG Report 2020  |  Our ESG pillars are guiding principles for the Universe 2023\nThe first pillar of our ESG strategy ensures that Abris is \na model organization for both our portfolio companies \nand the wider private equity ecosystem. We will always \nimplement and optimize each procedure ourselves, at \nAbris, before requesting that others adopt it.\nMeeting this goal requires three main elements that we \ndeveloped in 2020:\n\u2022\tTeam \u2013 experts committed to driving the entire process\n\u2022\t\t\nEducation \u2013 allowing us to continuously develop and \nshare our skills and knowledge\n\u2022\tPortfolio Corporate Governance \u2013 clear rules of \noperation and communication between decision \nmaking bodies \nOur Team\nThe ESG Team, as a part of the Value Enhancement \nTeam, is focused on delivering best-in-class ESG solu-\ntions and tools to the organization. Continuous support \nfrom and dialog with the Investment Committee and \nPartners Board illustrates the team\u2019s importance to \nAbris\u2019 strategy and investors\u2019 requirements.\nThe Value Enhancement Team works to support Deal \nTeams in risk management and value creation. The \nprimary areas supported by the Value Enhancement \nTeam include ESG, portfolio risk management and \nbusiness digitization. The team\u2019s main objectives are:\n\u2022\tProviding the time and resources necessary to sup-\nport Deal Teams\u2019 value creation for each investment\n\u2022\tBuilding an investment and portfolio experience \ndatabase\n\u2022\tContinuous professionalization of Abris Capital \nPartners\u2019 activities\nInternal ESG governance structure\nBuilding additional value using ESG is a joint effort \nbetween Abris and the portfolio companies. That is why \nAbris has extensive ESG policies and procedures, with \nmilestones and goals shared among the Investment \nCommittee, Investment Team and ESG Team. Further-\nmore, each company has its own ESG team and each \nCEO acts as a sponsor of these initiatives.\nCorporate governance\nCorporate governance is the backbone of an effective \nESG management system. That is why in 2020, we \nfocused on executing efficient implementation of the \nAbris Corporate Governance Model in each of our \nportfolio companies.\nThe primary goal was to strengthen standards of \ncorporate governance across all of the portfolio. We \nconstantly strive to perfect our governance system as, \nabove all, it helps to build a transparent, reliable and \nsustainable corporate culture. We also recognize that \nproper governance:\n\u2022\tAdds value to our investments, both through better, \nquantifiable performance (e.g., lower cost of pro-\ncurement) and through qualitative measures, such \nas increased valuation multiples (as a result of lower \nrisk of irregularities, increased transparency, ease of \nownership transfer or post-acquisition integration) \n\u2022\tAllows for a clear segregation of duties and com-\npetence among different corporate bodies and \ncreates transparent channels of communication \nand escalation.\n\u2022\tConstitutes a very effective defense mechanism \nagainst possible defects or crimes that might be \ncommitted, or appear to be, within our portfolio \ncompanies or externally, but with the participation of \ntheir employees. \nAbris assures consistency of main corporate govern-\nance procedures such as:\n\u2022\tAnti-corruption program\n\u2022\tWhistleblowing\n\u2022\tEqual Treatment and Diversity Policies\n\u2022\tCompliance Manual \u2013 polices & operating proce-\ndures\nEducation\nBy continually building knowledge through ongoing ed-\nucation, we are better able to innovate, solve problems \nand make higher quality decisions. That is why we have \nbeen developing Abris ESG Academy for several years. \nWe organize trainings and workshops for Investment \nTeams, members of the portfolio management boards \nand for portfolio company ESG teams.\nPillar I \u2013 Abris as a model ESG organization\nAbris \nlevel\nInvestment \nCommittee\nInvestment \nTeam\n\u2022\tInstills RI principles in investment procedures and portfolio companies\n\u2022\tAnalyzes ESG information in investment documentation\n\u2022\tProvides guidance on a wide range of ethical, governance, social and environmental \nchallenges\n\u2022\tExecutes on the ESG rules\n\u2022\tEnsures ESG due diligence\n\u2022\tIdentifies and manages ESG issues throughout the transaction process\n\u2022\tMonitors execution of ESG standards in the portfolio companies\nESG governance\nAbris \nlevel\nPortfolio \ncompany \nlevel\nESG  \nCoordinator\nESG Team\nESG Team\nESG \nAdministrators\nESG Director\n\u2022\tSets ESG goals and action plan\n\u2022\tOversees the implementation of ESG goals and projects\n\u2022\tCoordinates ESG activities\n\u2022\tReports internally\n\u2022\tOngoing management of ESG areas\n\u2022\tExecuting on ESG goals\n\u2022\tRaising management standards in ESG \n\u2022\tReports ESG incidents to the ESG Coordinator\n\u2022\tMonitor progress of ESG action plans\n\u2022\tDevelop Abris ESG standards\n\u2022\tImplements and develops the ESG process, i.e., Fund investment and \nportfolio monitoring\n\u2022\tDevelops ESG best practices\n\u2022\tCooperates closely with Investment Teams to review ESG progress\n\u2022\tPromotes the Abris ESG approach and methodology via industry \nconferences and ESG articles, brochures, etc.\n\u2022\tManges ESG external reporting, especially to the LPs\n\u2022\tSupervises ESG Coordinators\nESG Team\nDedicated \nPartner\n\u2022\tDirectly responsible for ESG integration \n\u2022\tCoordinates the Abris ESG efforts\n\u2022\tLeads ESG communication with the Abris Limited Partners\n Abris Capital Partners\n27\n26\nThe investment process\nSelection of targets \u2013 in-depth due diligence \u2013 contri-\nbution to the decision making process\nWe integrate ESG components into decision making \nmilestones at every stage of the investment process. \nFrom investment target identification, to investment \napproval, to exit, we set clear goals for the Deal Teams \nand deliver a precise value track record to the Abris \nInvestment Committee and Partnership Board.\nPortfolio monitoring \nTailor made planning \u2013 Regular review \u2013 measure-\nment of created value \u2013 Transparent reporting\nOur Investment and ESG Teams closely cooperate \nwith the portfolio companies. Once the transaction is \nclosed, the ESG Team performs an in-depth, post-ac-\nquisition analysis. Based on the results, both a long-\nterm and annual ESG Action Plans are formulated. \nThe ESG Action Plans are then agreed upon with the \nInvestment Team. Status of implementation of selected \nprojects within Abris\u2019 portfolio companies is tracked \nand measured by the ESG Scoring application.\nWe want to make it easy for our companies to join \nus in this effort. The ESG Team meets with company \nmanagement to present our approach and the ESG \nmanual is passed on to the Management Board. The \nportfolio company ESG team, supervised by the CEO, is \ncomprised of an ESG Coordinator and several internally \nrecruited members relevant to the business profile. \nProgress is evaluated during quarterly ESG calls, when \nthe current situation and any ESG incidents are dis-\ncussed. This information is presented to the Supervisory \nBoard in quarterly reports.\nIn 2020, the ESG Team conducted \n117 interviews during the annual ESG \nportfolio companies review. A total \nof 39 quarterly ESG calls took place \nbetween the team and portfolio \ncompanies.\nAt the beginning of each year, the ESG Team visits all \nportfolio companies. A comprehensive ESG analysis, \nsummary of the previous year and the ESG Action Plan \nfor the coming year are finalized. \nESG areas important for all Abris portfolio companies \nare:\n\u2022\tCorporate governance best practice & business \ncontinuity plan\n\u2022\tRemuneration and motivation\n\u2022\tAnti-corruption and whistleblowing\n\u2022\tAdaptation to climate change and managing \ncarbon footprint\n\u2022\tProducts and services security\n\u2022\tHuman rights and H&S standards\n\u2022\tCybersecurity\nThe ESG Team prepares materials, trainings, solutions \nand templates to help better manage these areas.\nThe Abris ESG Scoring Tool, from ESG to Value \nEnhancement\nWe have developed the Abris ESG Scoring Application, \nan innovative IT tool that supports investment decision \nmaking and ESG portfolio oversight. The key objectives \nare risk management and value creation through \nplanning, monitoring, and measuring our ESG impact. \nWe have recently added a carbon footprint and \nclimate change module, expanding the application\u2019s \nutility as a unique and forward-looking solution. \nWe are also working on two new portfolio value crea-\ntion modules:\n\u2022\tAn Internal Control Framework\n\u2022\tTechnology, cybersecurity and IT\nThe new Internal Control Framework is a comprehen-\nsive guide to creating and monitoring internal controls \nsystem. By introducing an Internal Control Framework, \nwe are able to design, implement and assess the \neffectiveness of all portfolio internal controls.\nThe technology, cybersecurity and IT module in ESG \nScoring is only one part of our systematic approach to \nmonitoring execution progress. Protecting IT systems \nfrom disruption and cyberattacks is critical to our \nbusiness. The scope of Abris\u2019 approach is divided into \nthree categories: business continuity resilience against \nsystems failures, cybersecurity strategy and digitaliza-\ntion. \nPillar II \u2013 End-to-end processes\nExclusion List\nEvery potential portfolio company is checked against \nthe Abris Exclusion List , based on international stand-\nards and all contractual terms included in our LPAs. \nOur criteria are based on the overarching principles of \nrespecting human rights and protecting the environ-\nment. \nThis means we will not do business with companies \ninvolved in, for example: \n\u2022\tActivities that contravene UN or EU conventions \non fundamental rights such as child labor, racial \ndiscrimination, trade embargo, environmental \nprotection \n\u2022\tProduction or trade of alcohol\n\u2022\tProduction or trade of tobacco\n\u2022\tDrift net fishing using nets in excess of 2.5 km. in \nlength\n\u2022\tMaterial / systemic corruption \nESG categorization\nThe ESG Team is working on an internal tool for desig-\nnating new targets to a relevant risk category, facil-\nitating better scoping and management of ESG due \ndiligence processes. \nESG due diligence\nESG is a mandatory component of the due diligence \nprocess at Abris. The ESG due diligence procedure \npertains to each new and add-on investment. For new \ntarget companies, the Investment Teams work with \nESG colleagues to determine the scope of ESG due \ndiligence required. When the process is completed, \nESG advisors submit reports to the Investment and ESG \nTeams for discussion. Significant issues are revealed \nin a red flag report to the Investment Committee. If the \ndeal is nearing its closing stage, a final report is pro-\nvided and reviewed. A Deal Qualifying Memorandum \nwith an ESG action plan is then sent to the Investment \nCommittee. The ESG plan is further developed into a \npost-investment 100-day plan.\n2 The full criteria are available from the Exclusion List on the Abris website: \nhttps://abris-capital.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Exclusion-list.pdf\nInitial stage\n\u2022\tExclusion List\nDue diligence\n\u2022\tESG categorization\n\u2022\tESG Due diligence \n\u2022\tRed Flag Report \nInvestment \ndecision\n\u2022\tDQM\n\u2022\tInvestment \nCommittee\n\u2022\t100-day plan\n\u2022\tESG action plans\nMonitoring & \nvalue creation\n\u2022\tPost-acquisition \nESG DD\n\u2022\tESG plan execution \n\u2022\tQuarterly calls \n\u2022\tAnnual monitoring \n& site visits \n02.

Learning from the pandemic experience \nhow to quickly develop risk management solutions, we \norganized workshops on the preparation and improve-\nment of Business Continuity Plans. Fifty participants \nof top portfolio company executives joined in our ESG \ntraining as a part of the ESG Academy.\nCEOs also had the opportunity to participate in a train-\ning on the business impact of climate change by the \nUnited Nations Global Compact Poland. We conducted \nworkshops on the analysis of climate change-related \nrisks and opportunities. As part of the ESG Academy, we \nalso initiated diversity & inclusion workshops. \nA responsible investor\u2019s credibility among its stake-\nholders is based on reliable ESG data and high-quality \ncommunication. Abris strives for a best-in-class report-\ning architecture to ensure the quality and value of \nour ESG impact and to allow for open communication \nwith our stakeholders. Engagement is how we impart \nour approach to sustainable business practices to the \nwider investment community. It is also how we present \nour views and expectations to portfolio companies. \nOur approach has been recognized by reputable inter-\nnational initiatives promoting responsible business. In \n2019, The Ethical Corporation shortlisted us for the Re-\nsponsible Investment Awards. We were recognized for \nour leadership in corporate responsibility, sustainability, \ntransparency, and investment stewardship. In 2020, \nour Agile & Comprehensive ESG Management System \nwas selected as the Emerging Markets Initiative of the \nYear by PRI.

Together we implemented the \nprojects to minimize and identify potential ESG risks \nand creating value.\nEnvironmental initiatives were a top priority at our \ncompanies in 2020. We utilize 107 separate measures \nfor analyzing key environmental indicators for our \nportfolio companies, such as: examining emissions, \nwaste, energy & water consumption, analyzing soil \npollution, monitoring climate change and environmen-\ntal requirements. Based on the results, each company \nreceives an action plan.\nWe manage risk and build value by using over 150 \nmeasures of social issues. Among those, we pay strict \nattention to Human Resources, Health & Safety, prod-\nuct/service safety. \nOur portfolio companies incorporate comprehensive \nHuman Resources processes, formalize topics such \nas working hours, overtime, salaries, holidays, the right \nto associate, outsourcing, labor law compliance, and \nmobbing/sexual abuse.\nIn 2020 our particular consideration was on imple-\nmentation of the Business Continuity Plan, 70% of our \nportfolio companies performed a comprehensive BCP. \n100% of companies participated in the training on how \nto prepare the Business Continuity Plan effectively.\nThe following examples illustrate the implemented ESG \nprojects in 2020:\nProject\n% of portfolio companies*\nArea\nCarbon footprint measurement in scope 1 and 2 \nEfficiency of water sources\nMeasuring the noise level at the production\nProcedures in place for managing waste\nAppointed a manager for environmental issues\nEnergy efficiency audits\nISO 14001 certification\nAnti-discrimination policy\nExperienced HR manager\nMachinery Safety audit\nISO 45001 certification\nSafe driving training \nH&S management system\nImplementation of actions to reduce the number of accidents\nAbris Corporate Governance Model\nBusiness Continuity Plan\nAnti-bribery policy \nESG Sponsor at Board level\n100%\n60%\n100%\n60%\n100%\n40%\n70%\n60%\n100%\n30%\n30%\n100%\n30%\n60%\n100%\n70%\n90%\n60%\nEnvironment\nSocial\nGovernance\n* average of portfolio companies obligated to implement the project\n Abris Capital Partners\n41\n40\n1. What would help accelerate the Abris portfolio\u2019s \ngreen transition, and how can the associated risks be \neffectively managed?\nThe transition toward carbon neutrality by 2025 is a \nvery ambitious target for Abris Capital Partners. It will \nrequire big investments and financing to maximize \nthe shift to renewable energy to effectively reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Thus, access to financing \nfor green projects is essential to a smooth transition. \nAlthough the EU promised such financing to help \ncompanies toward the transition through the Green \nDeal funds, the long timeframe of the European \nlegislation process and its implementation in Member \nStates is a risk that cannot be ignored. Therefore, Abris \nshould look to fund its energy efficiency and renewable \nprojects through private modes of financing. Moreo-\nver, countries where Abris portfolio of companies are \nlocated can oppose or delay the transition, even in an \nindirect form, by doing too little in that direction. This \nis a risk that Abris should take into consideration: they \ncannot rely on state policy measures but must pursue \na pro-active approach.\n2. Where is the value in the Gold Standard best \npractice standard and how do you see the current role \nof Green Group in the climate transition process in \nEurope?\nGold Standard is known throughout the world as one \nof the best promoter NGOs for the UN Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals through its certified green projects. \nGreen Group\u2019s plastic recycling project has been \ncertified by Gold Standard for its CO2 emissions savings \nand has obtained carbon credits that are needed by \ncompanies to offset their carbon footprint. This is a \npilot project in Europe that can be a model for other \nprojects to enhance the transition toward a circular \nand net zero emissions economy in the EU.\n3. How would you convince company CEOs that \nclimate change policies and GHG emissions reduction \ncreates value from a business standpoint?\nI believe it is quite difficult to convince companies \nand CEOs of the value of climate neutrality, at least in \nthe short-term, because they will always look at their \nyearly profit margin. In the medium- and long-run, \nGHG emissions reduction will save energy, gas, and \nother related costs. Moving toward ESG principles will \nboost profitability and increase investors\u2019 confidence in \nthe business. If CEOs base their decisions on a 10-year \nbudgetary framework, they cannot afford to lose the \nthread of this transition. \n1. How is business in Central Europe currently respond-\ning to climate change? How does the Abris carbon \nneutrality strategy fit into that context?\nUntil now, Central Europe has lacked leaders in manag-\ning its climate impact. But today we have a common \ninternational goal of climate neutrality by 2050, which \nis reflected in emerging legal regulations, sustainable \nfinancing, and changes in consumer behavior. Busi-\nness in Central Europe must reprogram its thinking, \nmeasure its carbon footprint, and define a strategy \nfor achieving climate neutrality. There is a lot of work \nahead for business, but today there is a lot of activity \nin this area. Abris\u2019 strategy of climate neutrality meets \ncontemporary challenges very well.\n2. Which climate change transition opportunities and \ntrends should Abris be considering when planning \nfuture investments?\nThe first things that come to mind are areas related \nto renewable energy sources and improved energy \nefficiency. In many industries, R&D encompasses ac-\ntivities that promote the mitigation of and adaptation \nto climate change, alongside product manufacturing \nand services that also contribute to climate change \nmitigation and adaptation for customers. These \nactivities align with a very strong trend of reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and building resilience to \nclimate change.\n3. Will customers and consumers be putting pressure \non suppliers in Central Europe if they disagree with \nregional and business climate policies, regulations \nand commitments?\nClients and consumers are already demanding carbon \nfootprint and/or environmental footprint disclosure, cli-\nmate change policies and strategies, climate neutrality \nstrategies, etc., from suppliers, as a basis for starting or \ncontinuing a collaboration or joint action regarding a \npolicy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It should \nbe noted that these requirements are presented \nmainly by companies from mature markets in Western \nEurope and Scandinavia, but also other regions of the \nworld. Emerging regulatory requirements, e.g., related \nto public reporting about managing the impact of \ncompanies on the climate or reporting to banks or \ninvestors in this regard will serve to spread these \npractices.\nCasiana \nFometescu\nInternational CO2 Consultant \nFounder of Carbon Expert \nwww.carbonexpert.ro \nMicha\u0142 \nStalmach \nSenior Sustainability Consultant \nat Bureau Veritas Polska\nESG Report 2020  |  Abris as a responsible and active owner\nThe actions we take are based on reliable knowledge, \nproven data and effective solutions.

From 2020, our products have been \navailable in 55 countries on six continents.\nCompanies and economies are more interdependent than ever, supply \nchains are more complex and interconnected, social and environmental \ntensions are more distinct than in the past and regulation is accelerating \nto address increasing imbalances between corporate growth and social \nneeds. \nKeeping our workforce safe is and always will be our top priority. We \nbelieve a safe company is a well-run company.\nDue to both the spread of Covid-19 and commodity price volatility, we are \nactively taking steps to mitigate business risk while continuing to ensure \nsafe, sustainable and reliable operations across our assets.

Therefore, the construction of new, highly \nflammable grain and oilseed storage silos has required \nus to upgrade our fire protections to the highest \npossible level.\nWe completed the drilling of our own well and the \nconstruction of a 100 m3 reservoir to provide a secure \nsupply of water to the fire hydrant network. This way \nour water supply became completely independent \nof the unstable city water supply system. Today, fire \nextinguishers have the necessary water pressure to \nreach a fire at extensive heights. Powerful aggregates \nhave been installed that provide the hydrants with \nwater under high pressure, even in the event of a \npower failure. \nResults\nIn terms of internal fire protection, we have covered \nall control rooms in the feed factory and in the premix \nfactory with fireproof panels, a reliable fire barrier. \nIn 2020, the premix and feed additive factories were \nequipped with a modern fire alarm system, as well as a \ngas leak detection system.\nWe also addressed fire prevention. All employees \nreceived additional training in fire protection. We con-\nducted a fire simulation in order to check employee \nresponses in emergency situations.\nSignificant funds were invested in improving fire \nprevention and firefighting systems as one part of our \nongoing efforts to achieve sustainable development \nand stable growth.\nTo facilitate entry into new markets \nand ensure legal compliance, we \nhave implemented a background \ncheck procedure for our potential \nbusiness partners. When we receive \ninformation about a potential client \nfrom the International Department, \nwe obtain the information from the \nnational authorities in order to get \na complete and accurate picture \nof the company. Following that, we \nreview the databases of the Minis-\ntry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic \nof Serbia, the European Commis-\nsion and the Security Council of \nthe United Nations to determine \nwhether any states, persons or \nentities are under sanctions.\nIn 2020, we purchased equipment \nthat provides excellent High Per-\nformance Liquid Chromatography \n(HPLC) daily analyses of vitamins in \nvitamin-mineral premixes. We have \nimplemented a new Quality Policy \nregarding quality and safety of \nanimal feed and premixtures and a \nnew Complaints Policy. \nWe are also among the first in \nthe world who have successfully \nimplemented the new FAMI-QS \nFeed Fraud Prevention and Defense \nModule, demonstrating our ability \nto effectively manage and mitigate \nthe risk of feed fraud and terrorism.\nOur main aimed is to ensure that \nour products are beneficial and safe \nfor animals, cost-effective for our \ncustomers and sustainable for the \nenvironment. We enthusiastically \nendorsed our owner\u2019s decision to \nemphasize ecology in 2020. The first \nstep was calculating our carbon \nfootprint. During the process, we \ndiscovered that there was room for \nimprovement in the manufacturing \nprocess and supply chain. We up-\ngraded the packing process, where \napplying a thin layer of biodegrad-\nable glue onto the bags enabled \nthe stability of the bags on the \npallet. We substantially increased \nthe sale of bulk animal feed and, \ntherefore, significantly reduced the \namount of packaging used.\n161k tonnes\nproduced and sold in 2020\n32%\nlowered production costs \nper kg from 2016 to 2020\n55 \ncountries on six \ncontinents\n 54\nFund II\nESG Report 2020  |  Portfolio overview\n55\nAbris Capital Partners\nEnvironment\nSocial\nGovernance\nKey project:\nOperation projects masterplan \nand weekly management review\nPehart is the biggest tissue paper producer in Romania and the largest \nindependent player in Southeast Europe with an annual turnover of more \nthan \u20ac100 million.\nPehart operates in two modern sites, one with a long history in producing \nnumerous types of paper products, opened 1837 and another one opened \nin 2015. Both are located in the country center, Transylvania. The company \nhas increased the tissue production capacity by 33% since Abris\u2019 entry \nwhile the converting capacity amplified 3 times.\nWe believe that technology and innovation are key to that growth. But we \nbelieve most strongly in people. They are the reason that we embrace \nsustainable ESG practices in our daily work; to create a more sustainable \nworld for our employees and our stakeholders. For example, transparent \ncommunication is at the core of our business. When it comes to con-\nsumers, we aim to communicate in a responsible, flexible, honest and \nconstructive way. This brings its own rewards in the form of increasing \nemployee and customer loyalty and pride in our work.\nGabriel Stanciu \nCEO Pehart\nOur mission is to grow our business by  \noffering products of the highest standards  \non the market at a price-to-quality ratio  \nthat is fair to consumers.\nPehart\nPehart developed an annual projects masterplan in \n2020, directed toward investment and cost-saving \nmeasures. Projects are first approved in the budget \nsubmitted to the Supervisory Board. A project leader is \nassigned and a time frame is allocated to each project, \nincluding a date for the first management review. The \nmanagement team will assess the status of the select-\ned projects on a weekly basis, then decide if and when a \nnew review should take place. Only when all results are \ndemonstrated to be sustainable is the project complete. \nResults\nThe masterplan helps to improve business results and \nallow management to exert more visibility and control \nover company resources. By measuring a project\u2019s de-\nvelopment and results, we can affirm the importance \nof both high-quality execution and meeting business \nexpectations. We also make sure that decisions re-\ngarding the allocation of the necessary resources are \ntaken early enough to ensure the best results. During \n2020, we recieved \u20ac750,000 in savings from projects \nimplemented under our new masterplan umbrella. \nIn addition, the masterplan drives organizational de-\nvelopment. Young professionals are trained in project \nmanagement principles and tools, entitled to project \nownership, encouraged to ask questions and access \ncompany resources. They will all receive management \nassessments.\nSince the masterplan was initiated, project manage-\nment knowledge and skills have spread throughout \nthe organization. The establishment of project tracking \ndiscipline and the empowerment of those colleagues \nbeneath the level of top management have made \nsignificant contributions to our company culture.\nWe implemented a self-service \nsystem for the spare parts ware-\nhouse. Anyone taking spare parts \nfrom the warehouse first scans \ntheir access card before the parts \ncan be taken. In this way, logs are \nautomatically updated in real-time \nwithout any printed and manually \nsigned documents.

While the Velvet CARE brand was established \nin 2013, the entire history of the company reaches back to the founding in \n1897. Velvet CARE operates in the following key tissue product categories: \ntoilet paper (dry and moist), kitchen towels, facial tissues and handker-\nchiefs. In 2020, Velvet CARE acquired the Czech company Moracell, also \ncovering similar market segments. \nThe company possesses 2 tissue machines, 14 converting lines in Poland \n(Klucze plant) and 2 converting lines in Czech (\u017dab\u010dice plant). The firm\u2019s \nmanufacturing output has tripled since its establishment (2013-2021).\nVelvet CARE is also an important supplier of Private Label products for \nthe whole CEE and DACH region and enters the AwayFromHome / Horeca \nsegment.\nWe grow dynamically and we aim to reduce our impact on the natural \nenvironment and carbon footprint. While steadily investing in continued \ndevelopment at our two plants in Klucze (Poland) and \u017dab\u010dice (Czech), \nwe follow Eco Agenda 2025 motto \u201cAchieve more with less.\u201d We continue \nworking in accordance with ethical standards, support our employees and \nthe local community. It was especially true in 2020, when we responded \nwith a high commitment to the challenges of the Covid-19 pandemic. \nOur reputation is built on doing reliable business and facilitating respon-\nsible and transparent cooperation with our partners. To emphasize the \nimportance of our ESG strategy and ensure its implementation, in 2020 \nthe management board decided to establish the new senior position of \nESG Leader. All these initiatives are designed to strengthen the company \nfoundation of the highest business standards, a sound ESG strategy and a \ncompetitive, ambitious organization.\nArtur Pielak \nCEO Velvet CARE\nIntroducing ESG standards at Velvet CARE \nis one of our key strategic initiatives to \nensure both sustainable development \nand\u00a0a\u00a0competitive advantage on the market. \nVelvet CARE \nIn 2019, we initiated our new sustainable development \nstrategy, Eco Agenda 2025. This provides a road map for \nthe ambitions and goals we set for the coming years. The \nagenda\u2019s motto \u201cAchieve more with less\u201d means that we \nalways strive to do more. Continual development is one of \nour core values. However, we wish to progress responsibly, \nwith respect for the environment upon which we all depend. \nEco Agenda 2025 focuses on three strategic pillars: Product, \nOrganisation & Infrastructure and Inspiration & Education. \n2020 was our first year for implementing the strategy \ninto real, tangible action. We undertook several new \ninitiatives, including environmental friendly changes to \na number of our products.\nResults\nWe introduced technological changes aimed at \necological benefits for our products. These changes \ndeliver environmental advantages in the areas of \nrecyclability, decreased plastic usage and a reduced \ncarbon footprint. \nFirstly, in the tissues category we re-designed the \ndimensions of Velvet facial tissue boxes to enable \nefficient storage and transport. This change also \nresulted in reducing our carbon footprint. Secondly, \nwe removed the foil insert from the opening in our \nfacial tissue boxes, thereby contributing to our plas-\ntic reduction initiative and helping consumers with \neasy waste segregation. Thirdly, we changed the box \nvarnish to a water soluble, ecological type. Finally, the \nnew cardboard used in Velvet tissues is FSC\u00ae certified, \nconfirming our care for forests and natural resources. \nIn the product categories that are foil packed, we \ndecided to reduce the material grammar, resulting in \na further reduction in plastic used. The total result is a \n5,9% reduction in our plastic usage in 2020 vs 2019. \nTo strengthen our principles of \nhonesty and ethics, the Procedure \nfor Identifying Potential Fraud has \nbeen implemented. It serves as a \nsupporting element for the trans-\nparency of our organization and \nas an essential tool for avoiding all \nforms of corruption. \nIn 2020, we established the imple-\nmentation of compliance clauses \nin our business contracts to ensure \nrespect for human rights and \nanti-bribery standards.\nDespite the challenges of Cov-\nid-19, development activities and \ntrainings were carried out as \nusual. However, it was important to \nlaunch new communication chan-\nnels (on-line) and provide tools to \nensure the health and safety of our \nemployees. \nAdditionally, an employee satis-\nfaction survey was conducted to \ncollect feedback that allows us to \nunderstand, revise and redefine our \nplans of continuous development. \nSustainable menagement of water \nresources in Velvet CARE is one of \nthe key elements of the company\u2019s \ndevelopment strategy. Owing to \nstate-of-the-art technologies used \nin our facility, consumption of fresh \nwater is limited and efficiency of its \ntreatment is continually enhanced.\nWe are constantly working to make \nthe consumption of energy that we \nneed, as low as possible. Actions \nthat were taken in 2020 include in-\nstallation of a water turbine by the \nTM7 paper machine and replace-\nment of lights for energy-saving \nLEDs in a part of the Klucze plant.\n124 yrs \npaper factory\n\u20ac 175M\nconsolidated turnover\n850 \nemployees \n(Velvet CARE & Moracell)\n 68\nESG Report 2020  |  Portfolio overview\n69\nAbris Capital Partners\nEnvironment\nSocial\nGovernance\n68\n69\nESG Report 2020  |  Portfolio overview\nFund III\nKey project:\nNew European Service Center and \nimplementation of the new ERP system \nWDX S.A. has over 25 years of experience in providing integrated intralo-\ngistics solutions.

The European Service Center was opened in 2020 and \nallows for centralized preparation of new and used forklifts for operation \nand, consequently, for the dynamic development of short-term rental. The \ncompany employs 360 people in six branches in Poland and is expanding \nits dealer network in Europe. WDX opened its branch office in Germany in \n2020.\nToday, our long-term strategy emphasizes two main areas:\n- Further improving corporate governance, business ethics and working \nconditions, as well as opportunities for our employees, our most valuable \nasset, to develop their skills \n- Environmental protection through the introduction of standards and \nmodern technologies that allow us to reduce pollutant emissions and de-\ncrease generated waste and to provide proper recycling methodologies.\nDariusz B\u0105kowski \nCEO WDX S.A. \nFor many years now, when developing our \nstrategies we focus on maximizing company \nprofits and shareholder value. But we do also focus \non environmental protection, social\u00a0issues and \nrelations with other stakeholder groups. \nWDX\nOne of our most important investments of 2020 was \nthe construction of the European Forklift Service \nCenter. The facility was built in Zgierz and has an area \nof 5,000\u00a0m2. The investment significantly raised work \nefficiency and services all forklift models that WDX \nhas in its portfolio. Through the introduction of quality \ncontrols and modern technologies, this new Service \nCenter meets the highest standards of environmental \nand safety regulations. \nIn 2020, WDX introduced the most modern forklifts on \nthe Polish market, meeting the highest standards of \nenergy efficiency and safety. Together with Crown, we \nare selling forklifts in Poland utilizing the GenaTM intel-\nligent operating system with a Polish language inter-\nface. GenaTM gives a forklift operator security reminders \nand dynamic real-time coaching messages that \nincrease safety during forklift operation. With Doosan \nwe have introduced a new S7 series of diesel forklifts \nthat meet the highest EURO5 standard, that leads to a \nreduction of exhaust emissions and noise.\nIn 2020, WDX was focused on implementation of a new \nERP system that not only enables better organization of \nprocesses and analysis of financial data, but also will \nallow WDX to better measure and understand non-fi-\nnancial factors during our analysis to identify material \nrisks. ERP implementation also triggered a process of \nreview of company policies. Process descriptions were \nupdated. Policy for Annual Stock Count, Fleet Policy and \nTravelling Policy were prepared and signed, others are \nbeing prepared or updated. \nAt WDX S.A., emphasis is placed on \ncompliance with the law when we \ndo business. To remind employees \nof existing regulations, we under-\ntook training activities in 2020. Also, \nan information campaign was \nlaunched that included presenting \ncompliance topics in an accessible \nway using posters placed in each \nbranch of WDX S.A. In addition, \ncompliance with the company\u2019s \nAnti-Corruption Policy was consist-\nently monitored.\nIn the summer of 2020, we installed \nan overhead crane with a lifting \ncapacity of 8 tonnes in the 18-me-\nter wide nave. This investment \nimproved assembly work and \nhas reduced the need for diesel \nforklifts in the crowded production \narea. This has increased the safety \nand comfort of our production \nemployees. The crane is invaluable, \nespecially when production teams \nmust lift elements that require \nbeing precisely connected.\nIn 2020, we replaced a twenty-\nyear-old powder paint shop with a \nnew, modern paint shop benefiting \nfrom improved technical param-\neters and reduced impact on \nenvironment. The powder used for \npainting is filtered in a closed cycle \n(without atmospheric emissions), \nallowing us to save thermal energy \nin winter. As a result, painting effi-\nciency has increased by providing \nsignificant savings in heat (gas) \nand water consumption.\n19,570\nforklift service orders \ncompleted annually\n20\nExport Sales to 20 \ncountries \n6k tonnes\nof steel per year \u2013 our \nproduction capabilities \n Abris Capital Partners\n71\n70\nESG Report 2020\nThe information contained in the report refers to 2020 unless otherwise stated.\nContact: Robert Sroka, ESG Director for CE, e-mail: r.sroka@abris-capital.com\nMonika Nachyla\nPartner\nOlga Jab\u0142o\u0144ska\nESG Coordinator \u2013 Poland\nRobert Sroka\nESG Director\nOana Mihai\nESG Coordinator \u2013 Romania\nAbris Capital Partners continues to participate in the United Nations Global Compact Initiative, focusing on the UNGC\u2019s \nten principles for Human Rights, Labor, Environment and Anti-Corruption.

This is exemplified by the Covid-19 \npandemic. Here at Abris, we have safely navigated through this time with a \nsense of responsibility and purpose from our teams. By teams, I mean the \nAbris, portfolio and investors\u2019 teams, but most importantly our families, who \nstood behind us with encouragement and a much-needed supporting smile.  \nI want to thank them for their strength, contributions and their kindness. \n2019 was a very busy year for our Abris ESG practice as we continued to incor-\nporate ESG principles into our investment activities.\nIn line with our commitments to sustainability, ethical stewardship and ESG dis-\nclosure, corporate governance was our 2019 ESG priority. We devoted the time \nand effort required to rethink our approach, study legislative changes, and \nreview our collective experiences. As a result, our new Corporate Governance \nCommittee developed a comprehensive model based on two central princi-\nples - building investment value and mitigating risks. The Corporate Govern-\nance Model has not only broadened our transparency, control, and distribution \nof competencies among the three corporate lines of defense, it has stream-\nlined the pivotal coordination between management and supervisory roles at \nall our portfolio companies.\nI am proud of the deep creative thinking process we have undergone in that \nproject. The first step in \u201ccreative thinking\u201d is always \u201cthinking.\u201d Yet, no single \nidea is flawless. Like a rough diamond, all new ideas have some defects. They \nmust be scrutinized and refined to fulfill their true promise. Therefore, we \nunderstand that unlearning, relearning, and unceasing questioning are key to \nthat process. In fact, these are some of our core strengths at Abris. They help \nus to continue evolving into a better, more resilient organization. \nDear Limited Partners  \nand friends,\nAbris has navigated the CE region  \nwith the eyes on the horizon and the world  \nin mind for the last decade.  \nWe know these waters by heart \u2014\nand we responsibly steer companies towards \nremarkable growth and great value.\nThe Value Enhancement Team established last year, represents that philoso-\nphy and our mission. Their role is to bring ESG standards, internal controls, and \nrisk management into our daily portfolio management standards and proce-\ndures to augment our impact. I am convinced that they can forge our experi-\nence and hard-won lessons into an invaluable asset for all our stakeholders.\nAbris has selected carbon footprint management as the new theme for our \nESG 2020 Universe program. As a responsible investor, we intend to invest \nheavily in developing an emission-neutral portfolio. Despite the challenges, \nwe are determined to support the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with a \nclear 2020 focus on SDG 13 - Climate Action. I know that pursuing such ambi-\ntious targets can be a never-ending journey and it will not happen overnight, \nbut I believe that whenever opportunity shows itself \u2013 we are there.\nI hope readers will gain an appreciation for the 2019 edition of our ESG report \nand the work we do to promote responsible business and community sus-\ntainability. To everyone at Abris, our partners and friends, please stay safe and \nhealthy.\nSincerely,\nPawel Gierynski\nManaging Partner\n ESG Report 2019  |  Abris as a responsible investor\n11\nAbris Capital Partners\n10\nThe Coronavirus pandemic has \nimposed an unprecedented \nglobal crisis, materially affect-\ning both Abris\u2019 activities and \nmodus operandi. The scale \nand depth of the impact on \nbusiness and everyday life \nexceeded all scenario planning \nincluded in the most visionary \nrisk management systems. \nThis situation should be con-\nsidered as a competence and \nresponsibility test, both for Abris \nor our portfolio teams. Even \nthough the test differed greatly \ndepending upon the business \nspecifics, the challenge was \nsignificant for all. \nAbris\nOur immediate reaction to the crisis \nwas reorganizing the firm\u2019s operating \nmodel to protect the team and se-\ncure continuous business processes. \nTherefore, all team members moved \nto remote working and meetings \nmigrated to online video conferenc-\ning platforms such as Zoom and MS \nTeams. We extended our business \ncontinuity plan with an internal \npolicy on the Coronavirus disease, \nintroducing strict rules on hygienic \nstandards, travel, interactions and \ncommunications. The new approach \nincluded regular internal coordi-\nnation meetings for the leadership \ngroup, weekly situation reporting, \ndaily interactions with the portfolio \nmanagement and constant monitor-\ning of governmental responses in CE \ncountries. Some team members as-\nsumed specific, new responsibilities, \nactively contributing to the building \nof a common knowledge database. \nAll deal teams shared their portfolio \nbest practices to accommodate any \nchanging legislative or administra-\ntive measures, as well as optimizing \nbusiness solutions. \nOpen and proactive investor com-\nmunications are key to Abris IR ac-\ntivity, therefore, a biweekly Covid-19 \nNewsletter was introduced imme-\ndiately. This included portfolio risk \nassessment, categorizing all com-\npanies into four groups: risk, concern, \npotential concern & no concern, \nwhile delivering clear data on risk \nevolution. Team status, the econom-\nic measures undertaken by each \ngovernment and valuation variations \nwere described whenever available \nand relevant, receiving a positive \nreception from all limited partners.\nIn parallel, all internal business pro-\ncesses were run in an uninterrupted \nmanner, including the Investment \nCommittee and Partners\u2019 meetings, \nregular monthly reporting, invest-\nment, and ESG activities. \nPortfolio\nFollowing the Abris ESG Corporate \nGovernance Model and well before \nthe pandemic emerged, all portfo-\nlio companies were requested to \nprepare and implement a Business \nContinuity Plan. The key focus of such \nplans was to secure the relevant level \nof crisis management, sufficient li-\nquidity and supply chain contingency \nplanning. Therefore, when confronted \nwith the new reality, all crisis manage-\nment teams were formed overnight, \nassuming decision making responsi-\nbility and ready to react quickly. \nOur priority was to secure human \nresources availability. All necessary \nmeasures were defined to protect all \nemployee groups, especially those \non the production lines. Special care \nhas been taken for the most vul-\nnerable employees, assuring social \ndistancing and medical help. All \nmanagement teams reviewed and \nidentified liquidity risks, established \nemergency action plans and se-\ncured an extension of bank facilities \nwhen necessary. Since international \nlogistics remained a significant chal-\nlenge for all production companies, \nincreased raw materials stocks were \nguaranteed and alternative suppliers \nidentified. \nDespite the challenging business \ncircumstances, most portfolio teams \ndemonstrated their responsible \nsocial commitment by launching \nnumerous projects supporting both \nlocal communities and healthcare \ninfrastructure. Those initiatives \nconsisted of direct financial aid, as \nwell as providing hygiene products \nand medical devices, confirming the \nteams\u2019 solidarity and responsibilities.\nPost Covid-19\nThe Abris team regards this current \ncrisis as an opportunity to stress-\ntest all portfolio business models, \nproactively looking for new oppor-\ntunities to modify and strengthen \nour investments. Learning from each \nexperience is an essential element of \nthe firm\u2019s philosophy and approach \nto business. Therefore, a compre-\nhensive review process has been \nconducted and transformed into \nstrategy enhancements for several \nportfolio companies. \nAbris and Abris portfolio  \ncompanies in coronavirus  \npandemic period update\n\u201cThe illiterate of the 21st \ncentury will not be those \nwho cannot read and write, \nbut those who cannot \nlearn, unlearn, and relearn.\u201d\n \nAlvin Toffler\n ESG Report 2019  |  About us\n13\nAbris Capital Partners\n12\nAbris Capital Partners is an in-\ndependent private equity fund \nmanager focused on mid-mar-\nket buyout and growth oppor-\ntunities in the major countries \nof Central Europe.

The company\u2019s unique \noffering is complemented by propri-\netary software platforms. \nPrior to investing, our ESG due dil-\nigence was focused on the legal \ncompliance, risk and best practices \nperspectives in the following areas: \nHuman Resources, Cybersecurity \n& Data Management, Anti-Bribery, \nCompliance, Environment, Health \n& Safety and the Supply Chain. An \nexperienced advisory firm was ap-\npointed to complete the process.\nDue to the complex nature of com-\npany operations and specialized \nknowledge required, a team of six \nexperts was appointed. The team \nwas assisted by our ESG Team during \ntheir site visits. A full 70-hour audit \nwas carried out. Up to 30 hours alone \nwas dedicated to data manage-\nment, identified as the most relevant \nof ESG risks. \nOur ESG Team members partici-\npated in revision of documents and \nevidence, site visits and interviews \nwith employees responsible for \nESG. The due diligence results were \npresented in a red flag report and \nthe conclusions included in a DQM \nfrom the Investment Team to the \nInvestment Committee.

It is vital that \nwe understand and mitigate these \nrisks and opportunities in the short to \nlong term. In 2019, following TCFD and \nPRI, we upgraded our ESG Scoring \nTool to advance the management \nof emerging risks and opportunities. \nMoreover, Abris implemented the \nfollowing:\n\u2022\tTraining and workshops\n\u2022\tTools for measuring carbon foot-\nprint and analyzing the climate \nchange risk \n\u2022\tPilot project to measure and set \nreduction goals in carbon footprint \nThese measures will be extended to \nall portfolio companies from 2020. \nWe have also developed the first \nphase of a carbon footprint tool for \nevaluating our entire portfolio of \ncompanies.

The \ndecision was based on the following \ncriteria: creating a positive environ-\nmental impact by eliminating plastic \nwaste and reducing costs through a \nfixed monthly fee.\nOne of the measures of suc-\ncessful staff recruitment is a \nrapid response to incoming CVs and \napplications. This allows us to quickly \nselect candidates and schedule \ninterviews in advance of the compe-\ntition. Therefore, we chose to use ATS \nsoftware in order to save time when \nmanaging recruitment and hiring. \nE-Recruiter enables total automation \nof our recruitment process and is \nGDPR compliant.

(\u201cScanmed\u201d), a leading private healthcare provider in Poland, to American Heart of Poland Group backed by Gruppo San Donato, an Italian hospital group. The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly clearance. Headquartered in Warsaw, Scanmed is the largest privately owned diversified in-patient group in Poland, operating 37 facilities across the country, including seven hospitals and 18 medical centers, and employing around 1,300 physicians. Abris acquired the business in 2021 with a plan to build a national healthcare champion by improving and growing the group\u2019s service offering in areas including cardiology, oncology, orthopedics and ophthalmology, and by expanding its country-wide geographic coverage. Wojciech Lukawski, Partner at Abris Capital Partners, commented: \u201cThis has been an exceptional value creation story over the past three years, as we have worked hard to transform Scanmed into the highest quality, fully diversified in-patient healthcare services provider in Poland. Through a combination of operational improvement, organic growth and the consolidation of several add-on acquisitions, the company has significantly exceeded the original investment case.\u201d Early in the investment period, Abris took the decision to recruit a new management team, bringing in a CEO, CFO and COO with a proven track record of business improvement and organic growth, to deliver a clear strategic vision. In addition, the Supervisory Board was strengthened with independent experts providing strong supervision over the highest industry and ESG standards integration. This enabled the group to build full independence and position itself for growth as a consolidation platform. During Abris\u2019 ownership, the company has introduced new therapeutic areas; grown the scale of multi-profile hospitals; delivered financial and operational synergies and cooperation between different units; and increased commercial revenues to complement publicly funded activities. The company has also focused on ESG-driven transformation and accelerated capex spending in critical areas to achieve the highest medical and operating standards. As a result, the quality of services and customer experience has increased, with patients now receiving much better, more coordinated and quicker treatment. During its investment, Abris also supported Scanmed with an ambitious buy-and-build program, completing the add-on acquisitions of ARS Medical in 2022, Med-Lux in 2023, and Centrum Rehabilitacji in Chorz\u00f3w and Vital Medic in 2024. These transactions enabled the group to continue delivering its above-market growth strategy by increasing its footprint and number of facilities, treating over 560,000 patients annually, expanding into new regions of Poland and covering a more diverse range of therapeutic areas. The company is an important player within Poland\u2019s national healthcare system, cooperating successfully with the National Health Fund. Pawel Gierynski, Managing Partner of Abris, said: \u201cOver the past three years, we have supported the creation of a versatile, regional provider of high-quality healthcare services in Poland. The combination of our ESG expertise and healthcare sector knowledge has enabled us to lead the transition towards best-in-class medical services and patient experience, as well as focusing on integrating the highest ESG standards. It has been a privilege to partner with experienced managers and the first-class medical team at Scanmed. We are confident they will have the opportunity to greatly contribute to the further development of the American Heart of Poland, not only in Poland but also across Europe.\u201d Andrzej Podlipski, CEO of Scanmed, added: \u201cWe would like to thank Abris for their enormous contribution to what has been a highly productive partnership over the past three years. As a group, we have focused hard on the quality of our facilities and services, on strengthening our long-term relationships with local communities, and on creating a better working environment for medical personnel. We now look forward to working with the American Heart of Poland and Gruppo San Donato, which will be a fantastic home for the top-notch medical team we have built and will enable us to continue growing and serving more patients every year.\u201d Healthcare is one of the five strategic sectors that Abris focuses on. It is underpinned by a rapidly ageing population in Poland and increasing government healthcare spending aimed at improving the quality of services and the comprehensiveness of care. Abris\u2019 previous investments in the sector include Matexlab, a Swiss vendor of innovative aesthetic medicine products, and Dentotal Protect, the leading distributor of dental consumables, instruments and equipment in Romania and Bulgaria.

The transaction is subject to Polish antimonopoly office approval and excludes Koral\u2019s fresh and smoked fish business, produced under the Superfish brand and private label. Headquartered in Wejherowo, Graal manufactures a wide range of canned and chilled fish-based products, as well as meat-based prepared foods. It produces branded products under the Graal, Neptun and Kuchnia Staropolska brands, and is a major private label supplier. The company will be acquired by Lisner Holding Sp. z o.o., which belongs to the German food business M\u00fcller Group (Unternehmensgruppe Theo M\u00fcller). Abris is exiting its investment following a six-year investment period during which the company has grown revenues and Ebitda consistently, despite the Covid-19 pandemic and geopolitical challenges. Wojciech Jezierski, partner at Abris commented: \u201cDuring our partnership with Graal and Bogus\u0142aw Kowalski we have helped create an unquestionable market leader with a diverse portfolio of branded and private label products. It has been a privilege to work with the extraordinary team at Graal. We are proud of what we have achieved together and are delighted that the business has found such a complementary partner in Lisner to continue its growth strategy\u201d. Abris acquired a majority stake in Graal in February 2017, in what was the first public-to-private transaction in which a private equity fund partnered with a business founder to complete a tender offer for 100% of a company\u2019s shares, and to subsequently delist the business from the Warsaw Stock Exchange. Since its investment, Abris has focused on implementing a broad range of value creation initiatives, including operational improvements, commercial strategy implementation, developing and strengthening the sales and marketing functions and investing significantly in capex programs. Graal Group (consisted of Graal and Koral) now operates from three manufacturing facilities and a distribution center in Poland, employing more than 2,200 people, and exports to 38 countries across Europe, North America, Asia, Africa and Australia. The Group recorded sales of PLN 1.6bn (EUR 350m) in 2022. Bogus\u0142aw Kowalski, CEO and founder of Graal commented: \u201cI\u2019m grateful to Abris, my business partner, for all we have jointly achieved over the past six years, which is more than we thought possible. After 33 years of development of the company, I will step aside at Graal after short transition period. Graal and its management is now looking forward to joining forces with Lisner. The Graal and Lisner businesses have strong product complementarity, and I\u2019m convinced that new owner will create fantastic opportunities for Graal to continue its growth strategy, entering new geographic locations in Europe and globally.\u201d Back to News page Media contact GlobalHydra Strategy Sam Barton *protected email* PolandSpectator PR Karol Chorazy *protected email* Jakub Zadrozny *protected email* RomaniaPR House Valeria Tudor *protected email* Contact Legal Sitemap LinkedIn \u00a9 Abris Capital Partners 2024"

The transaction is subject to European clearance. Headquartered in Klucze, Poland, Velvet CARE manufactures paper hygiene products including tissues, toilet paper and kitchen paper towels, and is the owner of the highly regarded Velvet brand in Poland. The company was established in 2013 but its origins date to 1897, including a period of 17 years under the ownership of International Paper and Kimberly Clark. During Abris\u2019 investment, Velvet CARE has grown sales by 2.5 times and EBITDA by more than five times, and expanded its export business fivefold, significantly exceeding the original investment case in terms of financial results and strategic development. In 2020, the company completed the add-on acquisition of Moracell, the largest manufacturer of paper hygiene products in the Czech Republic. Thanks to a comprehensive ESG programme, Velvet CARE received B Corp certification \u2013 the most prestigious, globally recognised ESG accreditation for businesses that demonstrate the highest standards of social and environmental performance, transparency and accountability \u2013 in 2023. The company also received a gold medal from Ecovadis, an independent sustainability rating agency. Tomasz Kujawa, an Investment Director at Abris, commented: \u201cWe are delighted to have had such a successful partnership with Velvet CARE\u2019s management team, supporting the company\u2019s expansion in Central Europe and beyond. During our investment, we have focused on transforming the business into a leading regional, vertically integrated player, capitalising on the growing demand for personal care and hygiene products, as well as expanding the company\u2019s export business, tapping into neighbouring markets, and integrating the highest ESG standards based on our ESG value creation methodology.\u201d Abris acquired a majority stake in Velvet CARE in 2018 from Avallon, a Polish private equity fund. Shortly after the acquisition, Velvet CARE completed a major capital expenditure programme, adding to its facilities one of the most modern tissue paper machines in Central Europe, which substantially increased its production capacity. Abris partnered with the company\u2019s management to drive organic growth, while seeking to acquire other attractive tissue businesses in the region. After the Moracell acquisition, which brought to the group a modern conversion machinery park, infrastructure and an established team in the Czech and Slovakian markets, Velvet CARE subsequently invested in another new tissue paper machine to further expand its production capacities and reinforce its position as Central Europe\u2019s market leader. Today, Velvet CARE has more than 850 employees based at its manufacturing facilities in Klucze and Zabcice, and at its commercial office in Warsaw. Its products are now sold in 30 countries. Artur Pielak, CEO of Velvet CARE, comments: \u201cOur close working relationship with Abris over the past five years has allowed us to significantly strengthen our market position. During this time Velvet CARE has grown stronger, going far beyond our initial ambitions. The management team and I can\u2019t wait to begin working with Partners Group and continuing our mission of building a European leader in this sector. This is yet another era of new possibilities for us and we plan to accelerate our growth, actively participating in the further consolidation of the paper market and seeking opportunities to expand, within Central Europe and beyond.\u201d Milorad Andelic, Member of Management, Private Equity Goods & Products Industry Vertical, Partners Group, added: \u201cVelvet CARE\u2019s extensive offering of staple products give the Company resilience and cash flow stability during macroeconomic slowdowns. At the same time, Velvet CARE\u2019s markets have strong, long-term tailwinds, with rising incomes driving demand for both premium and value products. Our value creation plan will focus on strengthening the Company\u2019s existing position while continuing to expand into other major European markets.\u201d Back to News page Media contact GlobalHydra Strategy Sam Barton *protected email* PolandSpectator PR Karol Chorazy *protected email* Jakub Zadrozny *protected email* RomaniaPR House Valeria Tudor *protected email* Contact Legal Sitemap LinkedIn \u00a9 Abris Capital Partners 2024"
